    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">I</font></strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">t is well recognized that the most frequent chronic
    complication of diabetes is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#1">1</a>,<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#2">2</a>). Dyslipoproteinemias are among the many potential risk factors that
    may account for this. The term <i>dyslipoproteinemia</i> is used rather than <i>hyperlipoproteinemia</i>
    because in diabetes there may be changes in both the quantity and the quality of the
    lipoproteins. One of the earliest suggestions that lipid abnormalities may be responsible
    for atherosclerosis in diabetes was voiced by E.P. Joslin: &quot;With fat diabetes begins.
    From fat diabetics die, formerly of coma recently of arteriosclerosis&quot; (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#3">3</a>). This article reviews some of the evidence relating
    dyslipoproteinemias to atherosclerosis in diabetes that has emerged since that assertion
    70 years ago.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Recognizing that feeding fat to rabbits resulted
    in the development of atheromatous lesions, Duff and McMillan (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#4">4</a>)
    reasoned that feeding similar fat loads to alloxan-diabetic rabbits would produce even
    more atheromata. However, when they conducted that experiment almost 50 years ago, they
    found just the opposite&#151;less atherosclerosis in the diabetic animals (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#4">4</a>). They did not recognize at that time that the activity of
    lipoprotein lipase is greatly reduced in diabetic rabbits. Therefore, the massive
    hyperlipidemia that they produced was due to an increase in chylomicrons. More recent
    studies, summarized later, indicate that the small triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, not the
    chylomicrons, are associated with the increase in atherosclerosis.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>LIPOPROTEIN ABNORMALITIES IN DIABETES</strong>&#151;
    Most groups that have quantified the lipoproteins in diabetes have found that the major
    abnormality is hypertriglyceridemia (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#5">5</a>&#150;<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#8">8</a>).
    The levels of cholesterol and LDL in diabetic patients are generally found to be similar
    to those in the general population. However, a few studies suggest that LDL decreases with
    short-term tight glycemic control (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#9">9</a>). HDL levels have been noted
    in different studies to be reduced, normal, or elevated. This probably reflects the nature
    of the hypoglycemic agent used by the patient and the presence or absence of the
    hypertriglyceridemia of obesity and of other disorders, such as nephropathy. A recent
    report of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study population indicates that these abnormalities
    are already found in type 2 diabetes at the time of diagnosis (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#10">10</a>).
    In fact, they have been noted in individuals who are normoglycemic but later develop
    diabetes (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#11">11</a>).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The last observation is consistent with those
    studies suggesting that hypertriglyceridemia is a part of the insulin resistance syndrome
    (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#12">12</a>). Some years ago, using tracer kinetic methods, we found that
    hypertriglyceridemia was associated with insulin resistance, even in men selected to be
    lean (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#13">13</a>). We then observed that reducing plasma triglyceride
    levels with gemfibrozil in a group of normoglycemic people did not change their glucose
    levels during a glucose tolerance test but did reduce their serum levels of insulin (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#14">14</a>). This indirectly suggested that insulin resistance was directly
    related to plasma triglyceride levels. Using hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp methodology,
    similar conclusions were reached in those with type 2 diabetes in fair control (fasting
    glucose &gt;9 mmol/l), but not in those who had better glycemic control (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#15">15</a>). Studies conducted by Vuorinen-Markkola et al. (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#16">16</a>) did not find a similar improvement in insulin sensitivity. The
    discrepancy may result from the fact that the first studies produced changes from levels
    above to levels below 1.5 mmol/l. However, the third study did not reduce triglyceride
    levels below that apparent threshold.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>CHOLESTEROL AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
    IN DIABETES&#151;</strong> The similarity of plasma cholesterol levels in those with and
    those without diabetes should not lead one to conclude that cholesterol has no coronary
    risk effect in diabetes. Recently, the Multiple Risk Factor Trial published its data on
    those with diabetes (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#17">17</a>). The incidence of coronary mortality
    increased in a curvilinear manner, with increasing concentrations of serum cholesterol
    both in those with and in those without diabetes. The two curves were of similar shape but
    differed, with the curve for those with diabetes being higher than the curve for those
    without. At any given serum cholesterol concentration, those with diabetes had a risk of
    coronary artery disease mortality between two and four times greater than the risk in
    those without diabetes. There may be several reasons for this. First, the level of
    cholesterol in the serum reflects the level of all lipoproteins, not just LDL. Thus, an
    elevation of serum cholesterol may, in part, indicate an increase in the triglyceride-rich
    lipoproteins. Second, there may be many nonlipoprotein atherogenic factors in those with
    diabetes that could increase the &quot;basal&quot; risk of coronary artery disease. These
    include the presence of advanced glycation end products (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#18">18</a>), the
    presence of nephropathy (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#19">19</a>), the presence of hypertension (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#20">20</a>), and changes in coagulation factors and platelets (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#21">21</a>), to name but a few. An elevation of cholesterol would then add to
    these. Third, LDL may be modified in a way that would make any given amount of it more
    atherogenic. Such modifications would include nonenzymatic glycation (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#22">22</a>),
    oxidation (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#23">23</a>), and a shift toward smaller and denser particles (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#24">24</a>).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>TRIGLYCERIDES AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
    IN DIABETES&#151; </strong>As noted earlier, the most frequent quantitative abnormality in
    lipoproteins in diabetes is hypertriglyceridemia. There is increasing support for the
    concept that hypertriglyceridemia confers an increased risk for coronary artery disease in
    the general population (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#25">25</a>). This is clearly recognized in
    univariate studies. However, meta-analysis of prospective studies also suggests that the
    risk effect of hypertriglyceridemia is independent of HDL (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#25">25</a>).
    Thus, probably both hypertriglyceridemia and low levels of HDL, not either one alone,
    contribute to coronary risk.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The data in those with diabetes are more
    restricted. An early suggestion of an association came from the World Health Organization
    Multinational Study, which found a cross-sectional association of ischemic
    electrocardiogram changes with hypertriglyceridemia (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#26">26</a>). More
    recently, the Paris Prospective Study observed that in men with diabetes or impaired
    glucose tolerance, coronary artery disease death was associated with an increase in plasma
    triglyceride concentrations (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#27">27</a>). Unfortunately, that study did
    not report HDL levels. Another prospective study from Kuopio, Finland, indicated that
    atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was associated with both an increase in
    triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and a decrease in HDL (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#28">28</a>).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>TRIGLYCERIDE-RICH LIPOPROTEIN PARTICLES
    AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE IN DIABETES&#151;</strong> The triglyceride-rich lipoprotein
    particles extend across a broad range of size and density. We have made use of the
    observations that each particle of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein contains one molecule of
    apolipoprotein B. This permitted an estimate of the numbers of particles by measuring the
    amount of apolipoprotein B in a given sample. In both those with diabetes (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#29">29</a>) and those without diabetes (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#30">30</a>), we found
    that three-fourths of the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles are in the smaller
    denser (Sf 12&#150;60) subfraction, a subfraction that has been called
    intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) by us and some others. Furthermore, 70% of the
    differences in plasma triglyceride concentrations in a population can be explained by a
    difference in particle number rather than in particle size. Almost 50 years ago, Jones et
    al. (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#31">31</a>) found that IDL levels were higher in male myocardial
    infarct survivors than in control subjects and that IDL levels predicted those who were
    likely to reinfarct. We found that IDL particle numbers and triglyceride content were both
    associated with coronary artery disease in men without diabetes and that this association
    was independent of both LDL and HDL (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#32">32</a>). Reardon et al. (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#33">33</a>) found that IDL levels correlated with the severity of
    angiographically evaluated coronary artery disease in women without diabetes. In a recent
    study of men and women with type 2 diabetes, we observed that triglyceride-rich
    lipoprotein particle numbers were increased in those who had moderate coronary artery
    disease on angiography compared with those who had only mild disease (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#34">34</a>).
    Multivariate analysis showed that age, low HDL, and sex were also related to coronary
    artery disease severity, but these were independent of each other and of the number of
    triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles. Interestingly, there was no further increase in
    particle numbers between those with moderate and those with severe disease. This raises
    the intriguing and as-yet-untested possibility that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins might
    be more related to the early stages of atherogenesis and that other factors might have
    more influence on the later stages.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>INTERVENTION STUDIES&#151;</strong>
    Although a number of trials have examined the effect on coronary disease of correcting
    dyslipoproteinemias (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#33">33</a>&#150;<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#41">41</a>), none
    that have been completed have specifically addressed the question in those with diabetes.
    Three of the published clinical trials have included some individuals with diabetes in
    their study population and have conducted a post hoc analysis of the data obtained from
    that subgroup. The first, the Helsinki Heart Study, was a primary prevention trial. Its
    diabetic subpopulation was too small to show a statistical difference. However, there was
    a trend in those with diabetes who were treated with gemfibrozil toward a reduction in
    coronary events (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#42">42</a>). The second was the Scandinavian Simvastatin
    Survival Study (4S). A secondary intervention study demonstrated that treatment of
    hypercholesterolemic individuals with simvastatin reduced coronary events and total
    mortality (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#35">35</a>). In the post hoc analysis of the diabetic
    subpopulation, there were also fewer coronary events, but there was no reduction in
    mortality (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#43">43</a>). In addition to the problems inherent in a post hoc
    subgroup analysis, those with diabetes in this population probably were not representative
    of the general diabetic population in the participating countries. Four percent of the 4S
    population had diabetes. This is about one-fourth the prevalence of diabetes in similarly
    aged people in those countries. Probably this is because of the exclusion criteria for the
    study. Among many of these criteria was the exclusion of those with a serum triglyceride
    &gt;2.5 mmol/l. The post hoc analysis of the diabetic population in a similar study that
    used pravastatin, the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) Study (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#39">39</a>),
    led to similar conclusions. Unfortunately, insufficient information is published about its
    diabetic subpopulation to be able to draw further conclusions. However, within the
    limitations of a post hoc analysis of secondary intervention studies in
    hypercholesterolemic populations treated with statins, both suggest that reducing
    hypercholesterolemia will reduce the risk of recurrence of coronary disease. Recently, the
    Veteran's Administration HDL Intervention Trial (VA-HIT) Study presented data indicating
    that treating those with low HDL but normal LDL levels with gemfibrozil resulted in a
    significant reduction in fatal and nonfatal coronary events and strokes (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#44">44</a>). Those with diabetes within the VA-HIT population had a very
    strong, but not quite significant, trend toward a similar benefit in clinical events. The
    recently completed St. Mary's, Ealing, Northwick Park Diabetes Cardiovascular Prevention
    (SENDCAP) Study was designed to examine the effects of bezafibrate on carotid artery
    intima-media thickness in those with type 2 diabetes. No effect was found. However, there
    was a reduction in the number of people who had electrocardiogram-defined probable
    ischemia or myocardial infarction (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#45">45</a>).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Some studies have now started with the primary a
    priori aim of determining whether lipid reduction in type 2 diabetes will result in less
    coronary atherosclerosis. The first of these is the Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention
    Study (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#46">46</a>). It is an angiographic study examining whether
    correcting dyslipoproteinemia in men and women with type 2 diabetes with micronized
    fenofibrate will alter the rate of progression or regression of their coronary artery
    disease. The protocol for this study has been published (<a href="../supplement399/C6.htm#44">44</a>). It
    is due for completion at some point in 1999. Other studies are designed to evaluate
    clinical events as their primary endpoint. They are in their early stages of recruitment
    and have not yet published their protocols. They include the Fenofibrate Intervention and
    Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) Study, a study using fenofibrate in those with type 2
    diabetes who have triglycerides &gt;1.0 mmol/l and a total cholesterol &lt;5.5 mmol/l if
    there is coronary disease and &lt;6.5 mmol/l if there is not (A. Keech, personal
    communication). Another is the Lipids in Diabetes Study (LDS), which is examining 4,000
    men and women who will be treated with micronized fenofibrate, cerivastatin, both, or
    neither (R. R. Holman, personal communication). Finally, the Collaborative Atorvastatin
    Diabetes Study (CARDS) is examining the effects of treating with atorvastatin 2,120 people
    with type 2 diabetes who have no clinical coronary disease, an LDL cholesterol <u>&lt;</u>4.14
    mmol/l, and triglycerides <u>&lt;</u>6.78 mmol/l (D.J. Betteridge, personal
    communication).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>CONCLUSIONS&#151;</strong> At this time,
    there is no direct information to indicate whether treating the hyperlipidemia of diabetes
    will or will not be beneficial in terms of coronary disease. However, inference from
    pathophysiological information and extrapolation from post hoc analyses support the
    treatment of hyperlipidemia where it exists in diabetes. The treatment regimens should
    optimize glycemic control and use diet and lifestyle modifications, as well as drug
    therapy directed to the specific lipoprotein disorder that is present.</font></p>
