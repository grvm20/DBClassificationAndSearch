    </font><font color="#000000" FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3">Hyperglycemia is
    often overlooked when a hospitalized patient is acutely ill and facing a life-threatening
    illness. Commonly, a patient is admitted with an acute MI or cerebrovascular accident and
    is coincidentally found to have an elevated admission glucose value. Often, such patients
    have no history of glucose intolerance.</font><big><font color="#000000"> </font></big></p>

    FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3">Physicians routinely discontinue their patients'
    outpatient diabetes care regimen and initiate sliding scale insulin coverage.<sup>3</sup>
    Many physicians erroneously consider this practice the standard of care. Concerns about
    precipitating hypoglycemia may limit more aggressive strategies for managing
    hyperglycemia, particularly when patients are not tolerating regular meals or when their
    intake is being limited for any of a variety reasons, including pending surgical
    procedures or diagnostic tests. </font></p>

    FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3">Despite the ease and high frequency of use,
    sliding scale insulin coverage often results in a deterioration rather than an improvement
    in glycemic control.<sup>3</sup> Concerns about hypoglycemia are warranted. However,
    hyperglycemia, regardless of whether a previous diabetes diagnosis has been made, may pose
    even greater risks by reducing hospital survival rates among patients admitted with stroke
    or MI.<sup>4-6 </sup></font></p>

    by stress or diabetes? It doesn't matter; treat it.</strong> <br>
    There are no unique diagnostic criteria that account for stress in acutely ill patients,
    nor are there recommendations for making a definitive diagnosis of diabetes in the
    hospital. There is a well-defined pathophysiology of the effects of intercurrent illness
    and surgery on carbohydrate metabolism, which may lead to hyperglycemia. However, many
    studies have also demonstrated that stress may result in diminished glucose values.<sup>7-20</sup>
    This reduction in glucose levels during times of stress is frequently attributed to
    insufficient administration of exogenous glucose. </font></p>

    subsequent glucose tolerance testing performed 2 months after hospital discharge.<sup>4,5</sup>
    The Diabetes Insulin-Glucose in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DIGAMI) trial demonstrated
    significant reductions in mortality when an intensive insulin regimen was administered to
    hyperglycemic patients hospitalized with acute MI.<sup>4,5</sup> Enrollment in the DIGAMI
