    type 1 diabetes is to lower GHb (or any equivalent measure of chronic glycemia) so as to
    achieve maximum prevention of complications with due regard for patient safety. To achieve
    these goals with intensive management, the following may be necessary:</font><big> </big><ul>

    </b>Type 2 diabetes treatment methods should emphasize diabetes management as a multiple

    oral glucose-lowering agents and/or insulin, with careful attention given to
    cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, and family
    history. Whether treated with insulin or oral glucose-lowering agents, or a combination,
    goals remain those outlined in Table 1. </font></p>

    CONSIDERATIONS</b></font><big> </big></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><b><p>Children and adolescents</b><br>
    Approximately three-quarters of all newly diagnosed cases of type 1 diabetes occur in
    individuals younger than 18 years. Care of this group requires integration of diabetes
    management with the complicated physical and emotional growth needs of children,
    adolescents, and their families. Diabetes care for children of this age-group should be
    provided by a team that can deal with these special medical, educational, nutritional, and
    behavioral issues. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>At the time of initial
    diagnosis, it is extremely important to establish the goals of care and to begin diabetes
    self-management education. A firm educational base should be provided so that the
    individual and family can become increasingly independent in the self-management of
    diabetes. Glycemic goals may need to be modified to take into account the fact that most
    children younger than 6 or 7 years have a form of &quot;hypoglycemic unawareness,&quot; in
    that they lack the cognitive capacity to recognize and respond to hypoglycemic symptoms.
    Intercurrent illnesses are more frequent in young children. Sick-day management rules must
    be established and taught to prevent severe hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
    that require hospitalization. A nutritional assessment should be performed at diagnosis,
    and at least annually thereafter, by an individual experienced with the nutritional needs
    of the growing child and the behavioral issues that have an impact on adolescent diets.
    Caution must be exercised to avoid overaggressive dietary manipulation in the very young.
    Assessment of lifestyle needs should be accompanied by possible modifications of the
    diabetic regimen. For example, an adolescent who requires more flexibility might be
    switched to a three� or four�insulin-injection program when needed.</font><big> </big></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>A major issue deserving
    emphasis in this age-group is that of &quot;adherence.&quot; No matter how sound the
    medical regimen, it can only be as good as the ability of the family and/or individual to
    implement it. Health care providers who care for children and adolescents, therefore, must
    be capable of evaluating the behavioral, emotional, and psychosocial factors that
    interfere with implementation and then must work with the individual and family to resolve
    problems that occur and/or to modify goals as appropriate. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>Information should be
    supplied to the school or day care setting so that school personnel are aware of the
    diagnosis of diabetes in the student and of the signs, symptoms, and treatment of
    hypoglycemia. It is desirable that blood glucose testing be performed at the school or day
    care setting before lunch and when signs or symptoms of abnormal blood glucose levels are
    present.</font><big> </big></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>For further discussion, see
    the American Diabetes Association's position statement, &quot;The Care of Children With
    Diabetes in the School and Day Care Setting.&quot; (<i>Diabetes Care </i>23 [Suppl

    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><b><p>Referral for diabetes
    management<br>
    </b>For a variety of reasons (e.g., intercurrent illness, DKA, recurrent hypoglycemia), it
    may not be possible to provide care that meets these standards or achieves the desired
    goals of treatment (Table 1). In such instances, additional actions suggested may include
    enhanced education of diabetes self-management, comanagement with a diabetes team, or
    referral to an endocrinologist. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><b><p>Intercurrent illness </b><br>
    The stress of illness frequently aggravates glycemic control and necessitates more
    frequent monitoring of blood glucose and urine ketones. Marked hyperglycemia requires
    temporary adjustment of the treatment program, and, if accompanied by ketosis, frequent
    interaction with the diabetes care team. The patient treated with oral glucose-lowering
    agents or MNT alone may temporarily require insulin. Adequate fluid and caloric intake
    must be assured. Infection or dehydration is more likely to necessitate hospitalization of
    the person with diabetes than the person without diabetes. The hospitalized patient should
    be treated by a physician with expertise in the management of diabetes. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><b><p>Diabetic ketoacidosis and
    hyper-osmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome </b><br>
    These conditions represent decompensation in diabetic control and require immediate
    treatment. Careful evaluation of the patient for associated or precipitating events must
    be undertaken (e.g., infection, medications, vascular events), and associated problems
    must be treated appropriately. Depending on the severity of the illness and available
    resources, treatment can be initiated in the physician's office, but it is best carried
    out in the emergency room, hospital room, or intensive care unit. Because of the potential
    morbidity and mortality of DKA and the hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome,
    prompt consultation with a diabetologist/ endocrinologist is recommended when the initial
    clinical and/or biochemical state is markedly abnormal, when the initial response to
    standard therapy is unsatisfactory, or when metabolic complications or cerebral edema
    occur. Recurrence of DKA demands a detailed psychosocial and educational evaluation by a
    diabetes specialist. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><b><p>Severe or frequent
    hypoglycemia </b><br>
    The occurrence of severe, frequent, or unexplained episodes of hypoglycemia may be due to
    a number of factors such as defective counterregulation, hypoglycemic unawareness, insulin
    dose errors, and excessive alcohol intake. Hypoglycemia may also be a consequence of the
    therapeutic regimen and always requires evaluation of both the management plan and its
    execution by the patient. Family members and close associates of the patient who uses
    insulin should be taught to use glucagon. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>The successful
    accomplishment of these goals requires more frequent patient contacts during readjustment
    of the treatment program and patient/family reeducation. </font></p>

    obstetrician, diabetes educators, including a nurse, registered dietitian, and social
    worker, and other specialists as necessary. In addition, these women must be trained in
    SMBG and may require specialized laboratory and diagnostic tests. For further discussion,

    </big><br>
    <font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3">Hypertension contributes to the
    development and progression of chronic complications of diabetes. In patients with type 1
    diabetes, persistent hypertension is often a manifestation of diabetic nephropathy, as
    indicated by concomitant elevated levels of urinary albumin and, in later stages, by a
    decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In patients with type 2 diabetes,
    hypertension often is part of a syndrome that includes glucose intolerance, insulin
    resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. Isolated systolic
    hypertension may occur with long duration of either type of diabetes and is in part due to
    inelasticity of atherosclerotic large vessels. Control of hypertension has been
    demonstrated conclusively to reduce the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy and to
    reduce the complications of hypertensive nephropathy, cerebrovascular disease, and
    cardiovascular disease. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><b><p>General principles </b><br>
    Lifestyle modifications should initially be employed to reduce blood pressure unless
    hypertension is at an urgent level. Such modifications include weight loss, exercise,
    reduction of dietary sodium, and limits on alcohol consumption. If lifestyle modifications
    do not achieve specified goals, medications should be added in a stepwise fashion until
    blood pressure goals are reached. Several medications in patients with albuminuria (e.g.,
    ACE inhibitors) appear to have selective benefit in patients with diabetes. Other
    cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking, inactivity, and elevated LDL cholesterol
    levels, should also be managed concomitantly. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><b><p>Specific goals of
    treatment </b><br>
    The primary goal of therapy for adults should be to decrease blood pressure to &lt;130/85
    mmHg. In children, blood pressure should be decreased to the corresponding age-adjusted
    90th percentile values. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>Hypertension in adults has
    traditionally been defined as a systolic blood pressure <u>&gt;</u>140 mmHg and/or a
    diastolic blood pressure <u>&gt;</u>90 mmHg. Most epidemiological studies have suggested
    that risk due to elevated blood pressure is a continuous function, so these cutoff levels
    are arbitrary. In the general population, the risks for end-organ damage appear to be
    lowest when the systolic blood pressure is &lt;120 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure
    is &lt;80 mmHg. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>For patients with an
    isolated systolic hypertension of <u>&gt;</u>180 mmHg, the goal is a blood pressure
    &lt;160 mmHg. For those with systolic blood pressure of 160�179, the goal is a reduction
    of 20 mmHg. If these goals are achieved and well tolerated, further lowering to 140 mmHg
    may be appropriate. (For more detailed information, see the consensus statement
    &quot;Treatment of Hypertension in Diabetes.&quot; [<i>Diabetes Care </i>16:1394-1401,

    <p><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><b>General principles </b><br>
    Persistent albuminuria in the range of 30�300 mg/24 h (microalbuminuria) has been shown
    to be the earliest stage of diabetic nephropathy and is a significant risk marker for
    cardiovascular disease. Patients with microalbuminuria will likely progress to clinical
    albuminuria (<u>&gt;</u>300 mg/24 h) and decreasing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over
    a period of years. Once clinical albuminuria occurs, the risk for end-stage renal disease
    (ESRD) is high in type 1 diabetes and significant in type 2 diabetes. If untreated,
    hypertension can hasten the progression of renal disease. Over the past several years, a
    number of interventions have been demonstrated to retard the initial development or rate
    of progression of renal disease. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><b><p>Specific goals of
    treatment </b><br>
    Intensive diabetes management with the goal of achieving near normoglycemia has been
    proved to delay the onset of microalbuminuria, and the progression of microalbuminuria to
    clinical albuminuria, in patients with type 1 diabetes.</font><big> </big></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>Lowering blood pressure to
    &lt;130/85, by any effective means, should be the goal in hypertensive individuals. A
    reduction in blood pressure will also decrease the rate of progression of diabetic
    nephropathy. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>In hypertensive patients
    with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes who have microalbuminuria or clinical albuminuria,
    treatment with ACE inhibitors has been shown to delay progression from microalbuminuria to
    clinical albuminuria and to slow the decline in GFR in clinical albuminuria. Because of
    the high proportion of patients who progress from microalbuminuria to overt nephropathy
    and subsequently to ESRD, the use of ACE inhibitors is recommended for all type 1 patients
    with microalbuminuria, even if they are normotensive. However, because of the more
    variable rate of progression from microalbuminuria to overt nephropathy and ESRD in
    patients with type 2 diabetes, the use of ACE inhibitors in normotensive type 2 diabetic
    patients is not as well substantiated as in normotensive type 1 diabetic patients.
    Therefore, treatment with ACE inhibitors in normotensive type 2 patients should be based
    on physician assessment. Should such a patient show progression of albuminuria or develop
    hypertension, then ACE inhibitors would clearly be indicated.</font><big> </big></p>

    ratio can be measured in a random urine specimen. Alternatively, measurement of urine
    albumin may be done on a 24-h or other timed urine collection. There is marked day-to-day

    3- to 6-month period should show elevated levels before a patient is designated as having
    microalbuminuria. Abnormalities of albumin excretion are defined in Table 5.</font><big> </big></p>

    and lipid abnormalities independent of the level of glycemic control. A common abnormal
    lipid pattern in such patients is an elevation of VLDL, a reduction in HDL, and an LDL
    fraction that contains a greater proportion of small, dense LDL particles. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>Data about treatment of
    dyslipidemia in people with diabetes, especially in children, are limited. However,
    current recommendations from the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment
    Panel II Report and the Expert Panel on Blood Cholesterol Levels in Children and
    Adolescents Report on the general management of elevated cholesterol and triglycerides
    have set increasingly stringent treatment targets based on the number of cardiovascular
    risk factors and the presence of CHD. Risk factors include age (men <u>&gt;</u>45 years or
    women <u>&gt;</u>55 years, or premature menopause without estrogen replacement therapy),
    diabetes mellitus, hypertension, HDL cholesterol &lt;35 mg/dl (&lt;0.90 mmol/l) in men and
    &lt;45 mg/dl (&lt;1.15 mmol/l) in women, smoking, microalbuminuria, and a family history
    of premature CHD. Because diabetes appears to eliminate the protective effect of female
    sex against CHD, all adults with diabetes are candidates for progressively aggressive
    therapy.</font><big> </big></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>The following
    recommendations are designed to achieve two major goals as a result of treatment of
    dyslipidemia: <i>1)</i> to reduce the risk for development of CHD in people without
    documented CHD and <i>2)</i> to reduce the risk for progression of CHD or to cause
    regression in people with known CHD. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>A meal plan designed both to
    lower glucose levels and to alter lipid patterns and regular physical activity are the
    cornerstones in the management of lipid disorders. The goal of MNT should focus on three
    major strategies: weight loss if indicated, increased physical activity, and MNT
    individualized for the patient. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>Weight loss is achieved by
    reducing total caloric and fat intake and by increasing physical activity. Recommendations
    for increased physical activity, however, need to be made in the context of the patient's
    history and medical status. The recommendations should detail a frequency, duration, and
    intensity of exercise. Lipid-lowering pharmacological agents are indicated if there is an
    inadequate response to a trial of MNT, exercise, and improved glucose control. (For a
    complete discussion of the treatment of lipid disorders, see American Diabetes
    Association: Management of Dyslipidemia in Adults With Diabetes [Position Statement]. <i>Diabetes
    Care</i> 23 (Suppl 1):S57-60, 2000.)</font><big> </big></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>The primary emphasis in
    children and adolescents with serum lipid abnormalities should be on glucose control, MNT,
    and exercise. Because there are important considerations regarding the efficacy and safety
    of drug therapy for dyslipidemia in children and adolescents, drug therapy in these
    individuals should be undertaken only in consultation with a physician experienced in the
    area of lipid disorders in children. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><b><p>Specific goals of
    treatment</b></font><big> </big><br>
    <font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3">The primary goal of therapy for adult
    patients with diabetes is to lower LDL cholesterol to <u>&lt;</u>100 mg/dl (<u>&lt;</u>
    2.60 mmol/l). </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>People with diabetes who
    have triglyceride levels <u>&gt;</u>1,000 mg/dl (<u>&gt;</u> 11.3 mmol/l) are at risk of
    pancreatitis and other manifestations of the hyperchylomicronemic syndrome. These
    individuals need special, immediate attention to lower triglyceride levels to &lt;400
    mg/dl (&lt;4.50 mmol/l). Further reduction to Adult Treatment Panel II goals of &lt;200
    mg/dl (&lt;2.30 mmol/l) may be beneficial.</font><big> </big></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>A secondary goal of therapy
    is to raise HDL cholesterol to &gt;45 mg/dl (&gt;1.15 mmol/l) in men and &gt;55 mg/dl
    (&gt;1.40 mmol/l) in women. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>The primary goal of therapy
    for children with risk factors in addition to diabetes is to lower LDL cholesterol to
    &lt;110 mg (&lt;2.80 mmol/l), following the recommendations of the National Cholesterol
    Education Program's Report of the Expert Panel on Blood Cholesterol Levels in Children and
    Adolescents.</font><big> </big></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><b><p>NEUROPATHY</b></font><big>
    </big><br>
    <font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3">Peripheral diabetic neuropathy may result
    in pain, loss of sensation, and muscle weakness. Autonomic involvement can affect
    gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary function. Each condition may require
    special diagnostic testing and consultation with an appropriate medical specialist.
    Improvement in neuropathy should be sought by increased attention to blood glucose
    control. Relief can be provided by various medications, alterations in MNT, or specialized
    procedures. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><b><p>FOOT CARE</b></font><big>
    </big><br>
    <font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3">Problems involving the feet may require
    care by a podiatrist, orthopedic surgeon, vascular surgeon, or rehabilitation specialist
    experienced in the management of people with diabetes. All patients, especially those with
    evidence of sensory neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, and/or altered biomechanics
    must be educated about the risk and prevention of foot problems, and this education must
    be regularly reinforced. </font></p>
    </div><div><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3"><p>Patients with a history of
    previous foot lesions, especially those with prior amputations, require preventive foot
    care and lifelong surveillance, preferably by a foot care specialist. (For a complete
