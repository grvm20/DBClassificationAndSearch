    <p><big><big><strong><font color="#804040">P</font></strong></big></big>eople with
    diabetes have a two- to fourfold increase in the risk of dying from the complications of
    cardiovascular disease. Both men and women are at increased risk. Atherosclerosis and
    vascular thrombosis are major contributors, and it is generally accepted that platelets
    are contributory. Platelets from men and women with diabetes are often hypersensitive in
    vitro to platelet aggregating agents. A major mechanism is increased production of
    thromboxane, a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregant. Investigators have found
    evidence in vivo of excess thromboxane release in type 2 diabetic patients with
    cardiovascular disease. Aspirin blocks thromboxane synthesis by acetylating platelet
    cyclo-oxygenase and has been used as a primary and secondary strategy to prevent
    cardiovascular events in nondiabetic and diabetic individuals. Meta-analyses of these
    studies and large-scale collaborative trials in men and women with diabetes support the
    view that low-dose aspirin therapy should be prescribed as a secondary prevention
    strategy, if no contraindications exist. Substantial evidence suggests that low-dose
    aspirin therapy should also be used as a primary prevention strategy in men and women with
    diabetes who are at high risk for cardiovascular events.<sup>1</sup></p>
    <p><strong>EFFICACY<br>
    Secondary Prevention Trials<br>
    </strong>A meta-analysis of 145 prospective controlled trials of antiplatelet therapy in
    men and women after myocardial infarction, stroke or transient ischemic attack, or
    positive cardiovascular history (vascular surgery, angioplasty, angina, etc.) has been
    reported by the Anti-Platelet Trialists (APT). Reductions in vascular events were about
    one-quarter in each of these categories, and diabetic subjects had risk reductions that
    were comparable to nondiabetic individuals. There was a trend toward increased risk
    reductions with doses of aspirin of 325 mg/day or less. It was estimated that 38 � 12
    vascular events per 1,000 diabetic patients would be prevented if they were treated with
    aspirin as a secondary prevention strategy. Comparable results were seen in males and
    females.</p>
    <p>These results are supported by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS).
    This population consisted of type 1 and type 2 diabetic men and women, about 48% of whom
    had a history of cardiovascular disease. The study, therefore, may be viewed as a mixed
    primary and secondary prevention trial. The relative risk for myocardial infarction in the
    first 5 years in those randomized to aspirin therapy was lowered significantly to 0.72 (CI
    0.55&#150;0.95).</p>
    <p><strong>Primary Prevention Trials</strong><br>
    The U.S. Physicians&#146; Health Study was a primary prevention trial in which a low-dose
    aspirin regimen (325 mg every other day) was compared with placebo in male physicians.
    There was a 44% risk reduction in the treated group, and subgroup analyses in the diabetic
    physicians revealed a reduction in myocardial infarction from 10.1% (placebo) to 4.0%
    (aspirin), yielding a relative risk of 0.39 for the diabetic men on aspirin therapy.</p>
    <p><strong>SAFETY</strong><br>
    A major risk of aspirin therapy is gastric mucosal injury and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
    These effects are dose related and are reduced to placebo levels when enteric-coated
    preparations of 75&#150;325 mg are used once daily. Minor bleeding episodes (epistaxis,
    bruising, etc.) may occur at low doses, probably from the effect of aspirin to inhibit the
    platelet release reaction. In several prospective studies, a trend for an increase in
    hemorrhagic stroke has been seen, but has not reached statistical significance.
    Contraindications to aspirin therapy include allergy, bleeding tendency, anticoagulant
    therapy, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, and clinically active hepatic disease.</p>
    <p>The ETDRS established that aspirin therapy was not associated with an increased risk
    for retinal or vitreous hemorrhage. Since the primary endpoint in this trial was
    retinopathy and maculopathy, these serial observations by ophthalmologists, using retinal
    photography in a group of diabetic subjects with retinopathy, established conclusively
    that aspirin therapy conveyed no increase in benefit or in risk regarding progression of
    diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy.</p>
    <p>Regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may increase the risk for chronic
    renal disease and may impair blood pressure control in hypertensive patients. However, a
    low dose of aspirin is a very weak inhibitor of renal prostaglandin synthesis and has no
    clinically significant effect on renal function or on blood pressure control.</p>
    <p><strong>DOSAGE </strong><br>
    The platelet release reaction is exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by aspirin. In this
    regard, it has been shown that a dose as low as 75 mg of enteric-coated aspirin is just as
    effective as higher doses of either plain or enteric-coated aspirin in inhibiting
    thromboxane synthesis. When platelet turnover is rapid, as may be the case with diabetic
    vascular disease, the steady plasma aspirin concentration from enteric preparations
    theoretically allows for constant suppression of thromboxane synthesis.</p>
    <p>The APT meta-analysis explored the results achieved with various doses of aspirin,
    alone or in combination with other antiplatelet agents, including dipyridamole and
    sulfinpyrazone. Whereas risk reductions of 21 � 4% were seen in cardiovascular events in
    30 trials in which doses of 500&#150;1,500 mg/day were used; a trend for greater risk
    reductions of 29 � 7% was seen in 5,000 patients in whom doses of 75 mg/day were used.
    Comparable risk reductions of 28 � 3% were seen in 12 trials in which doses of
    160&#150;325 mg/day were used. No evidence was found that combinations of aspirin with
    other antiplatelet drugs were any more effective than aspirin alone.</p>
    <p><strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS</strong><br>
    The meta-analysis of the secondary prevention trials provided sample sizes that were
    adequate to determine aspirin&#146;s efficacy in a wide variety of patients. Separate
    analyses were done in males and females, patients with or without diastolic hypertension,
    those over or under age 65 years, and in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. Proportional
    benefits of aspirin therapy were seen in all subgroups studied. Absolute benefit was
    greater among those at high risk (over age 65 years, diastolic hypertension, diabetes).
    Intervention trials in women are underway. Case control studies have shown that the use of
    one to six aspirins a week is associated with a reduced risk for myocardial infarction in
    women. Further, the APT meta-analysis of secondary prevention trials showed no difference
    in responses in men or women, and the ETDRS included men and women in the trial. Diabetes
    appears to place women at high risk for myocardial infarction. For these reasons,
    recommendations in this article apply to men and women with diabetes.</p>
    <p>Although data are limited in diabetic subjects, antiplatelet agents such as ticlopidine
    may be considered as a substitute in the case of aspirin allergy. One large-scale
    collaborative trial (Ticlopidine Microangiopathy of Diabetes [TIMAD]) showed that
    ticlopidine may slow progression of retinopathy. Other approaches, such as blocking a key
    platelet receptor (GPIIb/IIIa), are under study.</p>
    <p><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS<br>
    </strong>1. Use aspirin therapy as a secondary prevention strategy in diabetic men and
    women who have evidence of large vessel disease. This includes diabetic men and women with
    a history of myocardial infarction, vascular bypass procedure, stroke or transient
    ischemic attack, peripheral vascular disease, claudication, and/or angina.</p>
    <p>2. In addition to treating the primary cardiovascular risk factor(s) identified,
    consider aspirin therapy as a primary prevention strategy in high-risk men and women with
    type 1 or type 2 diabetes. This includes diabetic subjects with the following:<ul>
      <li>A family history of coronary heart disease</li>
      <li>Cigarette smoking</li>
      <li>Hypertension</li>
      <li>Obesity (&gt;120% desirable weight); BMI &gt;28 in women, &gt;27.3 in men</li>
      <li>Albuminuria (micro or macro)</li>
      <li>Lipids:</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Cholesterol &gt;200 mg/dl<br>
        LDL cholesterol &gt;130 mg/dl<br>
        HDL cholesterol &lt;40 mg/dl<br>
        Triglycerides &gt;250 mg/dl</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Use of aspirin has not been studied in diabetic individuals under the age of 30 years.</p>
    <p>3. Use enteric-coated aspirin in doses of 81&#150;325 mg/day.</p>
    <p>4. People with aspirin allergy, bleeding tendency, anticoagulant therapy, recent
    gastrointestinal bleeding, and clinically active hepatic disease are not candidates for
    aspirin therapy.</p>
