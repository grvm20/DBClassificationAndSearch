    (GDM) is defined as carbohydrate intolerance of varying degrees of severity with onset or

    is used for treatment or the condition persists after pregnancy. It does not exclude the
    possibility that unrecognized glucose intolerance may have antedated the pregnancy.<sup>1</sup></font><font

    incidence of this metabolic complication of pregnancy will also notably increase if the
    new diagnostic criteria extrapolated from the O'Sullivan and Mahan data by Carpenter and
    Coustan as suggested by the 4th International Workshop-Conference on GDM are accepted and
    widely used.<sup>4</sup> The new diagnostic criteria are suggested in part because of the
    thought that intervention at a lower level of blood glucose will help prevent the major
    complication of GDM, macrosomia of the infant.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="3" FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Currently, the American
    Diabetes Association is sponsoring the writing of a technical paper that will assess the
    scientific evidence on which the proposal to change the new diagnostic standard is based.

    there is still considerable controversy regarding the clinical importance of GDM and its
    significance to mothers and offspring, increased screening, identification, and intensive
    treatment appear to decrease the morbidity in infants of mothers with GDM. The major cause
    of morbidity in infants attributable to GDM is macrosomia (birth weight &gt;4,000 g), with
    its attendant higher rates of cesarean sections and birth trauma. Other causes of neonatal
    morbidity include hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and polycythemia.<sup>4</sup></font></font><big>

    GDM have a significant risk of developing GDM with a subsequent pregnancy, with recurrence
    rates ranging from 30ï¿½50%<sup>5</sup> to 65%.<sup>6</sup> In addition, women with GDM
    have a significant risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Studies show that
    22&#150;30% of women with GDM develop type 2 diabetes mellitus 7&#150;10 years postpartum,<sup>7,8</sup>
    and 50&#150;60% will develop type 2 diabetes during their lifetime.<sup>8</sup> The

    type 2 diabetes. This ability to predict who may go on to develop type 2 diabetes gives a
    window of time for any prevention techniques, an idea that has been used in the Diabetes
    Prevention Program of the National Institutes of Health.<sup>9</sup></font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Of even
    greater potential significance are the potential influences that GDM may have on the
    future health of the offspring. Long-term follow-up studies show an increased risk for
    obesity and glucose intolerance in offspring of mothers with diabetes, including GDM,
    present during the index pregnancy.<sup>10,11</sup></font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="3" FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Given the newer
    understanding of the importance of GDM, it is unfortunate that nutritional management, the
    cornerstone of treatment, is understudied. There are no randomized, controlled studies
    specifically looking at optimal medical nutritional therapy for GDM, lean or obese. Yet
    there are published reports of clinic programs that were able to get good infant and
    maternal outcomes by intensive monitoring of women with GDM using a wide range of
    nutritional practices (Langer, 55% carbohydrate, 20% fat, and Jovanovic, 40% carbohydrate,
    40% fat).<sup>12,13</sup> This article offers practical pointers that seem to make sense

    the rate of weight gain is normally approximately 3/4&#150;1 lb/week. Many women are
    gaining almost 2 lb/week when they are diagnosed with GDM. Slowing down the rate of weight

    <p><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" color="#000000" size="3">Often after being
    diagnosed with GDM, a woman's weight gain may cease for a period to 1&#150;2 weeks. This
    seems to be common and harmless in the absence of small to moderate ketones. Sweets often
    add as many as 25% of kcal to the diet, and when restricted may lead to the flattening of
    the weight gain curve. A change in body composition may also be to blame when the
    percentage of macronutrients in the diet is changed. If weight gain is not resumed after 2
    weeks, a thorough assessment of the diet and urinary ketones should be done. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif"><b><i>Calorie
    Intake</i></b></font></font><big> </big><br>
    </font><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" color="#000000" size="3">The
    &quot;ideal&quot; calorie intake to recommend for women with GDM is unknown. Caloric
    intake must take into account maternal height, pregravid weight, maternal age, gestational
    age, physical activity, and smoking. Whether one looks at organizations (National Research
    Council, American Diabetes Association, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology), or
    at published clinics/programs (Joslin Diabetes Center, International Diabetes Center,
    Sweet Success, etc.), the calorie level recommended for GDM varies widely. To give one
    guideline, 30 kcal/kg ideal body weight (pre-pregnant weight), 36 kcal/kg ideal body
    weight in the second trimester, and 38 kcal/kg ideal body weight in the third trimester
    may be used as a starting point.</font><font color="#000000"><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" color="#000000" size="3">In the long run, this
    lack of consensus on calorie level should not be a problem. The initial calorie level,
    used as a starting point, can easily be adjusted as a woman adopts the nutritional
    modifications and monitors her weight gain, appetite, and urinary ketones. Inadequate
    weight gain needs more calories in the face of small to moderate ketones. Excessive weight
    gain requires fewer calories. A detailed diet history before initiating meal plans can
    give a practiced eye advance notice if the calorie level proposed is workable. When a
    woman is eating a well-balanced diet without excessive fat and sugar, with meals and
    snacks spaced frequently and is getting regular exercise, her appetite should be a good
    guideline for adequate calories. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">For the
    majority of women with GDM, a calorie level of 2,200&#150;2,400 kcal is a good starting
    point. Having women keep food records helps both as a behavioral change tool and as a
    source of information for the health care provider on subsequent visits. For obese women
    with GDM, severe calorie restriction, 50% of normal, leads to ketonuria and ketonemia and
    is not recommended.<sup>16</sup> Moderate calorie restrictions (33% of normal calories),
    approximately 1,800 calories, has been shown to reduce macrosomia without neonatal
    morbidity or maternal ketonemia.<sup>17</sup> However, some risk to the fetus may occur in
    calorie restriction during pregnancy, even in obese women, and caution should be
    exercised.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>

    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">The last
    goal in Table 2 is predicated on the assumption that most patients with GDM will not
    typically be seen postpartum for medical nutrition therapy. Therefore, the impression that
    they get when they last see the doctor before delivery (perhaps that they should restrict
    carbohydrate and liberalize fat) is likely to be the impression that they are left with
    until they are again diagnosed with GDM or diagnosed with type 2 diabetes later.</font></font><big>
    </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">To date,
    three different approaches to maternal euglycemia in GDM are emerging. Central to all is
    the agreement that increasing maternal glucose level is the gold standard for monitoring
    pregnancies complicated with GDM, and that increasing maternal hyperglycemia leads to
    increasing neonatal morbidity. One approach uses a higher-carbohydrate/lower-fat diet, of
    55% carbohydrate, 25% protein, and 20% fat, and a larger percentage of women on insulin to
    achieve these goals.<sup>12</sup> The second approach advocates use of carbohydrate
    restriction and a higher-fat diet (35&#150;ï¿½40% carbohydrate, 20&#150;25% protein,
    35&#150;40% fat) to achieve maternal euglycemia with fewer women on insulin.<sup>13</sup>
    The third approach, by Clapp, has yet to be tested on GDM. This approach uses
    low-glycemic-index carbohydrates, higher carbohydrates, and lower fats (55&#150;60%
    carbohydrate, 17&#150;19% protein, 20&#150;25% fat) rather than higher-glycemic-index
    foods to achieve lower postprandial blood glucose values. Clapp also notes that exercise
    proves a useful adjunct to treatment, consistent with what others have found.<sup>18</sup></font></font><big>

    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Of concern

    <p><font color="#000000">1.<big>&nbsp; </big></font><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif"
    size="3" color="#000000">Does 35% of total energy from cabohydrate distort the diet,
    making the diet deficient in micronutrients? Nutritionists are not naive enough to suggest
    that we have put all necessary vitamins/minerals into a prenatal supplement.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3" color="#000000">2.&nbsp; Is keeping
    carbohydrates as low as 35% of total calories really preferable to starting insulin? As
    the per centage of carbohydrates in the diet is decreased, the percentage of fats
    increases. Therefore, whenever carbohydrate restriction is used, a high er-fat diet is
    employed.</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3" color="#000000">3.&nbsp; Does a diet
    with 40% of calories from fat give a woman at risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2
    diabetes as well as obesity a head start on developing more insulin resistance?</font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3" color="#000000">Perhaps, instead of
    restricting carbohydrates (&lt;45% of total energy), the use of high-glycemic-index foods
    and more consistent (daily) exercise would obviate the need to have two diets (one
    prenatal and one postpartum) and the concern regarding inadequate micro- nutrients.
    Certainly more research is needed to answer these questions. </font></p>

    to prevent the use of insulin is more cost-effective<sup>19</sup> and that the medical
    nutrition therapy for GDM is not intended to address the issue of long-term diabetes
    prevention (see Table 3). They need to show <i>1)</i> that these women are not staying on
    high-fat diets (&gt;38% of calories) postpartum and <i>2)</i> that their rate of
    conversion to type 2 diabetes is not accelerated by this higher-fat diet. Certainly the
    cost-effectiveness of delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes is greater than that of not
    using insulin during pregnancy. Gregory showed theoretical savings of more than $71
    million in health care dollars assuming a 10% reduction in such conversion could be

    <p><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3" color="#000000">In addition to the
    amount of carbohydrate, the timing and distribution of carbohydrate intake is also

    Several studies have shown that SMBG improves outcomes in pregnancies complicated by GDM,
    lowering the incidence of macrosomia, cesarean sections, and birth trauma.<sup>21</sup>
    With new meters and lancing devices, the process of obtaining a drop of blood to determine
    blood glucose levels is virtually painless. Meters and lancet devices are much more easily
    available now, and insurance coverage for devices and strips is less of a problem.
    Reflectance meters with a memory significantly improve accuracy of reporting and
    compliance.<sup>22</sup></font><font color="#000000"><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3" color="#000000">SMBG empowers women
    with GDM, allowing them to become active participants in achieving euglycemia. Monitoring
    will give these women immediate feedback about portion size, particular foods that cause
    hyperglycemia, stable temporal patterns of elevated blood glucose levels, and where in the
    day exercise is most likely to help keep blood glucose in the target range. With this
    information, women are free to make choices and to see the effects of those choices in a
    timely manner. Studies have shown that SMBG helps with adherence to the goals of treatment
    in addition to reassuring women without causing undue stress and potentially saving the
    expense of neonatal intensive care.<sup>23</sup> Patients are more likely to believe the
    advice they receive when they can see high blood glucose levels 2 hours after a known
    indiscretion or when they can see blood glucose levels come down with walking. SMBG allows
    adjustments to be made to the meal plan/exercise program to normalize blood glucose
    levels. Without SMBG, the meal plan, solely a starting point, cannot be individualized to
    the different responses that many women have. And lastly, SMBG allows the earlier
    introduction of insulin, which likely is important in preventing macrosomia. </font></p>

    of blood glucose readings to obtain daily can be anywhere from 4 to 7. Postprandial
    glucose levels are more closely related to fetal risks than are fasting levels. Therefore,
    in addition to fasting levels, postprandial blood glucose readings are recommended. There
    is no consensus on whether a 1-hour or a 2-hour postprandial reading is best.<sup>4</sup></font></font><big>

    this pre-breakfast urine ketone measurement is often overlooked. It is recommended for
    patients on hypocaloric or carbohydrate-restricted diets.<sup>4</sup> For dietitians who
    are evaluating the effectiveness of a meal plan, the persistence of small to moderate
    ketones can signal inadequate calories, a misunderstanding of the meal plan, or a woman
    secretly restricting food to avoid the addition of insulin. It is an inexpensive tool that
    gives objective information on actual caloric and carbohydrate intake. In the future,
    there will be a better quantitative test that measures serum betahydroxybutyrate, the more

    of keeping records of all food and caloric beverages consumed can, by itself, alter
    caloric intake and rate of weight gain. The food record does not need to be shown to

    <p><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3" color="#000000">Three days of food
    records before the first visit with a dietitian or whomever is instructing on the meal
    plan will give good data regarding the appropriate kcal level and particular food habits

    <p><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3" color="#000000">Anytime blood glucose
    levels are outside of the target level, women should be instructed to write down what they
    ate at the last meal. Luckily for most of us, remembering a meal eaten 2 hours ago is
    within our grasp. This information proves helpful in trying to assess whether the high
    blood glucose seen is due to dietary indiscretion, to a particular food or food portion,
    or to inadequate insulin production. </font></p>

    as a treatment modality for GDM has received more attention lately. A regular exercise
    program is an important part of any healthy pregnancy. For GDM, however, it has added
    benefits in that it increases insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake by contracting
    skeletal muscles. It has been found in a small study to lower fasting and postprandial
    blood glucose levels on oral glucose tolerance test.<sup>24</sup> Bung and Artal encourage
    the use of an exercise program early in pregnancy, <i>daily </i>exercise, and using
    walking for larger muscle groups than arm ergometry.<sup>25</sup> They recommend an
    individualized program, perhaps starting at 20 minutes/day and gradually increasing to
    45&#150;6</font><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font

    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">The
    American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has published guidelines for safe exercise
    during pregnancy and also gives guidelines for which women should not be encouraged to
    exercise.<sup>27</sup> In general, for a healthy pregnancy, moderate regular exercise of a
    nonstanding nature (cycling, swimming) that does not require a lot of balance, when
    well-hydrated and well-nourished, is encouraged. Hypertensive women, however, should not
    exercise, as this may lead to preeclampsia.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Brisk
    walking, cycling, and swimming are often done safely by pregnant women. Communities often

    an accurate picture.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3" color="#000000">SMBG and food records
    are analyzed to fine-tune the meal plan. For example, some women can tolerate more
    carbohydrate at breakfast, but fast-food dinners lead to hyperglycemia. Records of rate of
    weight gain, food intake, and ketonuria are also used to fine-tune the meal plan. For
    example, a very obese woman with no weight gain over a 1-month period but whose records
    show at least 2,200 calories of good nutrient composition, with no ketonuria, is less
    worrisome. Many very obese women have weight gains and rates of weight gains much lower
    than recommended, but still deliver healthy infants of good birth weight. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Telephone/fax
    management can be a cost-effective means of using these tools to make course corrections
    in therapy. In many programs, women with GDM are asked to call/fax records in weekly. A
    health care practitioner (RD, CDE) skilled in working with these women can use the records
    to reinforce the initial concepts taught, answer questions that come up as a woman works
    with the program, and monitor records for those who are in need of extra help (i.e.,
    insulin).</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3" color="#000000">If a woman receives a
    call from the program asking for her SMBG, ketonuria, and food records, it reinforces the
    expectation that this is important. This type of program also catches the high blood
    glucose levels that are not necessarily brought to the attention of the physician. Many
    times when blood glucose is elevated, a patient who has been instructed to call will not
    do so, whether from fear or denial. A weekly call-or-get-called program will not let this
    continue for 2 weeks or possibly a month until the next physician appointment. </font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3" color="#000000">My particular bias is
    for telephone management, rather than fax management, because a therapeutic bond is formed

    (35&#150;4</font><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font
    FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">0% of kcal) requires an increase in fat as a percentage
    of calories (40%). These levels are identical to the levels shown to increase insulin
    resistance and conversion to type 2 diabetes in nutritional epidemiological studies. The
    message that this gives women is that whole grains or milk products are &quot;bad&quot;
    and that oils, margarines, and high-protein foods (at least one-half of which are fat
    calories) are &quot;good.&quot; This may be the last dietary message a woman hears at the
    prenatal visit with her physician until 7&#150;10 years later, when she develops type 2
    diabetes. The message to lower fat postpartum may be given but may seem weak in comparison
    to the emphasis on a low-carbohydrate diet (high-fat) given prenatally on a weekly basis.

    (not &lt;50% of calories) distributed among 3 meals and 3 snacks first. A percentage of
    women will not keep blood glucose levels within target range on this amount. It may help
    to decrease to 45% of calories. Use a daily exercise program as an adjunct to treatment if
    possible to help attain maternal euglycemia. If blood glucose cannot be kept within target
    range, insulin may be added. If the practitioner chooses to use a lower carbohydrate level
    (&lt;45% of kcal), be sure to educate and evaluate postpartum whether this woman has
