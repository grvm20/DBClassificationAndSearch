    color="#000000" FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3">he World Wide Web continues to
    expand, evolve, reinvent itself, and dramatically change our lives. <i>Fortune</i><sup>1</sup>
    magazine recently reported that business school graduates have contracted &quot;.com
    fever,&quot; spurning offers from prestigious mainstream U.S. companies to join Internet
    start-ups.</font><font color="#000000"><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">The Web
    invasion of medicine is proceeding at a slower pace, but it is in sight. <a
    href="http://www.Drugstore.com">www.Drugstore.com</a>&nbsp; and <a
    href="http://www.planetrx.com/">www.planetrx.com/</a>&nbsp; are challenging established
    pharmacy retailers. Healtheon (<a href="http://www.healtheon.com">www.healtheon.com</a>)
    and its newly acquired WebMD (<a href="http://www.webmd.com">www.webmd.com</a>) seek to
    integrate the incredibly diverse information resources involved in medical practice. Their
    goal is to create an Internet-based health care network that connects physicians,
    hospitals, third-party payors, and patients to a virtual world of medical information,
    tools, and services. <a href="http://www.Drkoop.com">www.Drkoop.com</a>, which offers
    health information for consumers, has affiliated with America Online, one of the world's
    largest Internet service providers, as well as with many community providers of health
    care. The company is attempting to &quot;empower consumers to become active, well-informed
    participants to better manage their health care.&quot;<sup>2</sup></font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3">Several other Web sites
    long to be the portal that commands the attention of health professionals, as well as
    patients and the public with questions about or an interest in health-related information.
    After attracting a critical mass to their sites, they could generate revenue through
    advertising, sale of products and services to their audience, or sale of information about
    their registrants to others. Hopefully, they would ask permission to do the latter.
    Enticements being offered to attract registrants include continuing medical education
    (CME) programs (<a href="http://www.medscape.com">http://www.medscape.com</a>),
    discipline- and disease-specific aggregations of information present elsewhere on the Web
    (<a href="http://www.medmatrix.org">www.medmatrix.org</a>), and medical news (<a
    href="http://www.reutershealth.com">www.reutershealth.com</a>). </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">The Web
    promises to revolutionize all of medical education but particularly CME programs.
    Organizations such as the American Diabetes Association (ADA) conduct popular and highly
    evaluated CME meetings. However, only a small fraction of those who would like to attend
    or would benefit from these programs can arrange to attend them in person. Each year,
    there are many more valuable CME programs than anyone can possibly attend. The ADA and
    other CME sponsors are beginning to provide some of their meeting content on their Web
    sites. Session summaries from volunteer reporters, sometimes including key graphics from
    the presentations, are becoming more common.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Some sites
    are providing more extensive communication of the presentations, including multimedia
    elements. Medscape adds key slide graphics from the presentations about which it reports.
    For many presentations, it also adds images of speakers and an audio file including a
    brief interview with the presenter. Other sites, such as the Vascular Biology Working
    Group (<a href="http://www.vbwg.org">www.vbwg.org</a>), offer online presentations with
    actual slides and their accompanying talking points. Still other sites (<a
    href="http://www.lipidhealth.org">www.lipidhealth.org</a>) allow one to view or download
    PowerPoint presentations that also contain talking points incorporated in the notes view
    of each slide. Lipidhealth also provides case studies, as do many other Web sites aimed at
    physicians.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3">As bandwidth increases
    and the ability to access audio and video from the Web increases in concert, one will be
    able to readily transmit actual presentations from meetings. This will allow all of us,
    independent of our busy schedules, to select and obtain (sometimes purchase) specific
    presentations from meetings that occur throughout the year and throughout the world.
    Obviously, this will fundamentally change CMEs. People will still attend live CME
    presentations, not only because they like to ski in Vail and eat in New Orleans, but also
    because of the opportunity to network in person with both the faculty and other
    registrants. But the Internet will allow each of us access to many more CME programs and
    presentations each year. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3">The real challenge,
    however, will be for the producers of these CME products to develop applications that take
    greater advantage of the electronic medium by including more images and links to actual
    references and to entire Web sites that contain additional information. This will allow
    users to navigate through the information according to their own interests rather than
    simply following the organization decided on by the presenter. These added enhancements
    may also encourage even those attending the presentations in person to purchase some of
    these CME products. Furthermore, we all need to learn whether different types of
    information have greater value in different formats (images, text, video, audio) or may be
    of greater value to some users in one format and to other users in different formats. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3">Of course, the above is
    really a new form of medical publishing. But traditional medical journal publishing is
    also being transformed by the Web. Publishers of most major medical journals now have Web
    sites. Most provide the table of contents of each issue online with links to citations,
    often including abstracts. Many also have links to the full text of selected
    contributions. Increasingly, publishers are making available to subscribers of print
    editions the full text of each issue online as a value-added service, with or without a
    small surcharge. Publishers of many journals in MEDLINE have provided links to their
    journal Web sites. Clicking on such a link in PubMed (a version of MEDLINE made freely
    available on the Web by the National Library of Medicine) will take you from a citation of
    interest to the journal Web site and usually access to the full text of the original
    article. User registration, a subscription fee, or some other type of fee may be required
    to access the full text of the original articles in some journals. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Conversely,
    when a subscriber is viewing the full text of a journal that includes links to the PubMed
    citations of the references cited in the articles, a click on the reference number will
    take you to the reference, and a click on the reference will take you to the PubMed Web
    site and the complete citation of the reference, including abstract if available.
    Moreover, if you wish to find additional papers devoted to the same topic, a click on
    PubMed's &quot;find related&quot; button will automatically return a list of additional
    references. Thus, a reader can navigate from a phrase in an article to the full reference
    including the abstract, to a list of similarly focused papers that can be used to further
    explore a topic. The ability to link to MEDLINE references clearly illustrates a major
    benefit of having literature in electronic form and is provided to subscribers of ADA
    journals as well as many others.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Many
    journals, including those published by the ADA, are beginning to allow a user without a
    subscription to obtain the full text of an article of interest for a transaction fee. For
    example, if one accesses the table of contents of <i>Diabetes Care</i> (<a
    href="http://www.diabetes.org/DiabetesCare/default.asp">http://www.diabetes.org/DiabetesCare/default.asp</a>),
    the ADA will make the full text of some articles available to all at no charge. Those with
    a subscription can have access to the full text of any article. But those without a
    subscription may obtain any article in full text as an HTML or PDF (portable document
    format), which can be viewed with the free Adobe Acrobat Reader file. Users simply click
    on the article link and confirm that they wish to purchase it. If they have registered a
    credit card, a download is immediately enabled.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">There are
    many examples of medical textbooks online (e.g., <a href="http://www.harrisonsonline.com">http://www.harrisonsonline.com</a>,
    <a href="http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim">http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim</a>, and <a
    href="http://www.samed.com">http://www.samed.com</a> ), and e-medicine (<a
    href="http://www.emedicine.com">www.emedicine.com</a>) has announced development of a new
    networking online writing software package that allows authors and editors from around the
    world to write textbooks online quickly and efficiently.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">But as
    frenetic as these diverse technological advances appear, they are but an early harbinger
    of much more dramatic changes that the Web will bring to medicine. Physicians are
    increasingly communicating with their patients via e-mail and through their own Web pages.
    Already, physician services including prescriptions are being offered on the Web.</font></font><big>
    </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Obviously,
    this raises a number of legal and professional issues. Can a cybervisit ever substitute
    for a face-to-face real-time visit to a physician in his or her office? If so, what are
    the virtual interactions and services that could appropriately take place?</font></font><big>
    </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" size="3">I don't think we
    presently know the answers. Perhaps electronic communication can supplement the
    increasingly time-constrained office interactions between physicians and their patients.
    Perhaps before an office visit, patients could communicate information about their status
    (self-monitoring of blood glucose values, blood pressure measurement, symptoms, etc.) to
    their physician and receive recommendations and educational information from their
    physician. Then the office visit itself could be more efficiently used to address specific
    issues needing more clarification and the accomplishment of tasks (such as a physical
    examination) that at present require an in-person office visit. </font></p>
