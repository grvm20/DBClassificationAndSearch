    <hr>
    <p><font size="5"><strong>I</strong></font><font size="3">n managing diabetic neuropathy,
    a major goal of most patients and their physicians is control of pain. A large number of
    treatments have been studied in both uncontrolled and controlled clinical trials. Patients
    with symptoms of &lt;6 months' duration associated with alterations in glycemic control
    have a good prognosis when compared to patients with chronic symptoms lasting longer than
    6 months. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to be effective. A
    placebo-controlled, single-blind, crossover study demonstrated both ibuprofen, 600 mg
    q.i.d., and sulindac, 200 mg b.i.d., to be more effective than placebo in relieving the
    pain of diabetic neuropathy. The response to sulindac was significantly better than the
    response to ibuprofen.<sup>1</sup> Caution must be exercised when using nonsteroidal
    anti-inflammatory medications in patients with diabetes because of the risk of
    nephrotoxicity, although none was noted in the study above. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Tricyclic antidepressants have also been studied extensively.
    Amitriptyline, imipramine, and desipramine were all found to relieve pain in patients with
    diabetic neuropathy better than did placebo in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.
    These compounds were effective in both depressed and nondepressed patients, and the
    efficacy appeared to be independent of any antidepressant effect.<sup>2-5</sup> Additional
    support for the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants was provided by a meta-analysis of
    21 different clinical trials.<sup>6</sup> </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Although nortriptyline as monotherapy would also be expected to be
    effective in treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy and is often used in this manner,
    there is no study to support its use. All of the tricyclic antidepressants may produce
    sedation, confusion, and anticholinergic side effects such as constipation, dry mouth,
    blurred vision, urinary hesitancy, and orthostatic dizziness. These agents are
    contraindicated in patients with a variety of heart diseases and must be used with great
    caution in patients with orthostatic hypotension or angle-closure glaucoma. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Arranged in order from most to least potent anticholinergic effects, the
    most commonly used agents are amitriptyline, imipramine, nortriptyline, and desipramine.<sup>7</sup>
    Thus, for patients who do not tolerate amitriptyline, other tricyclic antidepressants,
    particularly despiramine, may represent useful alternatives. The usual dosage schedule is
    10&#150;25 mg at bedtime initially, increasing as tolerated up to 100 or 150 mg as a
    single bedtime dose. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Serotonin reuptake inhibitors are another category of antidepressants
    that may have some efficacy, but the evidence for this is less convincing than that for
    tricyclic antidepressants. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, paroxetine, 40
    mg per day, reduced symptoms significantly more than did placebo, although it was somewhat
    less effective than imipramine.<sup>8</sup> Fluoxetine at a mean daily dose of 40 mg was
    shown to be no more effective than placebo except in patients who were depressed in a
    double-blind, placebo-controlled study.<sup>5</sup> Open-label sertraline up to 150 mg/day
    was shown to lead to a reduction in pain from diabetic neuropathy in a small study of 8
    patients, but a placebo-controlled study has not yet been carried out.<sup>9</sup>
    Trazodone is often used empirically. Open-label use raises the possibility that it may
    have some efficacy in treating painful diabetic neuropathy, but there are no controlled
    studies.<sup>10</sup> </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Another group of medications with utility in pain control is the
    anticonvulsants. Gabapentin has been shown to be more effective than placebo when used in
    doses ranging from 900 to 3,600 mg per day.<sup>11</sup> The lower end of this dosage
    range may be relatively ineffective; another placebo-controlled study did not demonstrate
    efficacy at a dose of 900 mg per day.<sup>12</sup> The main side effects of gabapentin are
    dizziness, somnolence, headache, diarrhea, confusion, and nausea. The dose is typically
    started at 300 mg per day or less, and increased very gradually, up to a maximum of
    2,400&#150;3,600 mg per day if tolerated and as needed for control of pain. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Carbamazepine, 200 mg t.i.d., was more effective than placebo in a
    double-blind crossover trial.<sup>13</sup> Side effects are somnolence, dizziness,
    unsteadiness, nausea, and vomiting. We suggest beginning at 100 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d.,
    increasing gradually to 200 q.i.d. as tolerated and if needed for pain control. Because
    aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis may occur on rare occasions, patients should undergo
    hematologic monitoring at baseline and regularly while being treated. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Double-blind studies have not demonstrated efficacy of phenytoin in
    patients with diabetic neuropathy<sup>14,15 </sup></font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Several other oral agents have been used. Randomized, double-blind,
    placebo-controlled trials of the anti-arrythmic agent mexiletine have demonstrated
    efficacy in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy.<sup>16-18</sup> Tramadol acts
    via low-affinity binding to micro-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of norepinephrine
    and serotonin reuptake.<sup>19</sup> It was recently found to be effective in treatment of
    pain in diabetic neuropathy in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial.<sup>20</sup>
    It is often good treatment for breakthrough or refractory pain and can be given as
    50&#150;100 mg every 4&#150;6 h, up to 400 mg per day. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Narcotic analgesics are often used for severe, refractory pain but are
    controversial for treatment of this chronic condition, because of the habituation that
    typically occurs. Some experts use them at night for sleep, but patients must be cautioned
    not to escalate the dose. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Not all agents for pain control must be administered systemically.
    Topical capsaicin cream stimulates the release and subsequent depletion of substance P
    from sensory fibers. A placebo-controlled study<sup>21,22</sup> demonstrated the
    superiority of capsaicin cream 0.075% to placebo in control of pain and improvement of
    daily activities, whereas another double-blind study found it to be overall as effective
    as amitriptyline.<sup>23</sup> In contrast, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of
    capsaicin cream in patients with chronic distal painful neuropathy of various causes
    demonstrated no benefit over placebo.<sup>24</sup> </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Overall, capsaicin cream appears to be effective. A meta-analysis of
    four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of capsaicin in diabetic
    neuropathy found capsaicin overall to be more effective than placebo.<sup>25</sup> Poor
    compliance is common because of the need for frequent applications, an initial
    exacerbation of symptoms, and frequent burning and redness at application site. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Other nonsystemic treatments that have been studied include
    transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) units and acupuncture. In a controlled
    study, TENS was more effective than sham treatment in reducing pain in patients with
    diabetic neuropathy.<sup>26</sup> Uncontrolled studies of TENS and of acupuncture have
    been reported to decrease pain in &gt;75% of patients with diabetic neuropathy.<sup>27,28</sup>
    However, the powerful effect of placebo treatment in diabetic neuropathy, documented in
    multiple studies, raises questions about the reliability of such uncontrolled trials. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">In summary, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can offer pain relief,
    especially in patients with musculoskeletal or joint abnormalities secondary to
    long-standing neuropathy. The tricyclic antidepressants remain the most commonly used
    drugs in the treatment of painful neuropathy. After 6 weeks of treatment, many patients
    report significant pain relief independent of mood but correlating with increasing drug
    dosage. The topical cream capsaicin may be added to the patient's therapeutic regimen if
    neuropathic pain persists in spite of treatment with maximally tolerated doses of
    antidepressant medication. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">In an outpatient setting, approximately two-thirds of diabetic patients
    treated with a combination of antidepressant medication and capsaicin cream experience
    substantial relief of neuropathic pain. In patients who experience continued pain on
    combination therapy, an anticonvulsant can be added as a third drug. If neuropathic pain
    persists despite these treatments, referral to a specialist for consideration of the other
    treatments mentioned may be helpful, although the prognosis for pain relief in these
    patients is poor. </font><b></p>
