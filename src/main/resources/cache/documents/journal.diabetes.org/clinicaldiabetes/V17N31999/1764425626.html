    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif"><b>What Is
    the Problem?</b></font></font><big> </big><br>
    </font><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" color="#000000" size="3">Many computer
    programs represent dates in the form mm/dd/yy, in which the year is represented by two
    characters. In most applications, the century could correctly be inferred to be
    &quot;19,&quot; thus saving two characters of storage space and avoiding two keystrokes
    during data entry.</font><font color="#000000"><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">As the
    inevitability of January 1, 2000, becomes reality, this inference may no longer be
    correct. The resultant date ambiguity may cause significant problems for computers and
    their users. Incorrect date representation within the computer system probably will not
    cause it to stop running altogether but may cause it to run incorrectly or, worse still,
    may cause data corruption.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">As computer
    microprocessors are now ubiquitous, this problem is pervasive. Any device with an embedded
    microprocessor or that is date-dependent is at risk. Computers and telephones and their
    associated software, including office practice management and patient data systems and
    claims and billing systems, may fail. Biomedical equipment, including electrocardiograph
    machines and laboratory and radiology equipment, are also dependent on computers. Glucose
    meters have embedded microprocessor chips and are time/date dependent. Facilities and
    infrastructure&#151;the office building ventilation, heating, cooling, power,
    water&#151;and external business partners&#151;banks, creditors, insurance companies, and
    suppliers&#151;are all potential sources of Year 2000 (Y2K) problems for your medical
    practice.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">According
    to the U.S. Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, the health care
    industry is less prepared than industry in general for the millennium change. The nation's
    largest hospitals, while progressing with remediation of their computer programs, lack the
    facilities to completely test their systems. Rural and inner-city hospitals are even less
    likely to be ready because they have more limited resources and older equipment. All
    hospitals rely heavily on vendors of medical devices and at present have limited
    contingency plans in the event that problems arise.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Doctors'
    offices face many of the same issues but are generally without access to the technical and
    financial resources required to repair older computer systems. Although doctors' offices
    frequently use computer-based practice management systems and submit claims
    electronically, they fortunately have little in the way of automated patient records.
    There is universal electronic data interchange with Medicare.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" color="#000000" size="3">Perhaps of greatest
    concern to physicians' practices is the health care payment system. The Health Care
    Financing Administration (HCFA), which administers Medicare, is responsible for about half
    of all health care payments, amounting to about $1 billion daily. There are 38 million
    Medicare recipients. The nations 5,200 hospitals and 780,000 physicians rely heavily on
    this source of revenue. HCFA required four-character year representation on all claims
    submitted after April 1, 1999, and has stated that, &quot;We are confident that all
    Medicare claims processes will be ready and able to function come January 1, 2000, so that
    you can be paid promptly.&quot; (DeParle N.M., HCFA Letter to Providers, Jan. 12, 1999.) </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Assuring
    that pharmaceutical supplies will be uninterrupted is particularly problematic.
    Pharmaceutical suppliers rely on foreign suppliers and subsidiaries. About 80% of the
    basic ingredients for pharmaceutical products come from abroad. More than 80% of the
    world's supply of insulin, for example, is produced in Denmark. Pharmaceutical suppliers
    employ &quot;just in time&quot; inventory processes. They have many business partners. The
    supply of certain drugs may be interrupted if any of the suppliers, subsidiaries, or
    business partners have significant Y2K problems.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif"><b>What
    Should I Do Before January 1, 2000?</b></font></font><big> </big><br>
    </font><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" color="#000000" size="3">Finding all
    instances of Y2K problems is probably impossible. Finding those that place your practice
    at significant risk is critical. This begins with a careful assessment, resulting in an
    inventory of all systems and devices that may be at risk. This includes all computer
    equipment and programs; all interchange of data within your office and with external
    partners; all medical devices, facilities, external business partners, and related
    practices; hospitals; and health plans.</font><font color="#000000"><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">With the
    inventory in hand, contact all vendors and request certification letters. You can get more
    information about biomedical equipment from the Food and Drug Administration Internet site
    listed in the Internet Resources section below. Pay particular attention to your claims
    processors' requirements.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Contact all
    external business partners, including your bank, creditors, and the insurance companies
    and health plans with which you have contracts. Discuss payment options if either you or
    they are temporarily unable to process claims. Think carefully about your office's
    facilities, contacting all providers of equipment, including elevators and environmental
    controls. Contact pharmaceutical suppliers and other suppliers to evaluate the possibility
    of interruption in their deliveries. With this information, you can determine your
    compliance options. Focus your efforts on assuring uninterrupted patient care and safety,
    on your office operations, and on fiscal integrity.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Fixing
    noncompliant computer programs comes in the form of software &quot;patches&quot; or by
    replacing the software with a new version. Patches generally provide an interpretation of
    the two-character year field using a &quot;window.&quot; A 30:70 window, for example would
    interpret two character years &quot;00&quot; through &quot;30&quot; as belonging to the
    new century and &quot;31&quot; through &quot;70&quot; as belonging to the old. The window
    may &quot;slide&quot; along as the next several years go by, always looking forward 30
    years and back 70.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Rewritten
    software may use date expansion so that the year is represented in four characters rather
    than in two. Expanded year fields are unambiguous, and programs running now with such year
    representations do not have a Y2K issue.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Even if
    windowed programs run correctly now, they may fail when presented with &quot;00&quot; next
    year. Of greater potential problem are programs that exchange data, one using date
    expansion, and the other windowing. In such cases both programs must know how to correctly
    interpret and reformat the date data of the other. While such issues are the concern of
    your computer, software, or device vendors, they may offer you the option of
    &quot;patches&quot; or new remediated programs. Patches are generally satisfactory and
    often less costly, especially if you plan to replace the system within the next several
    years.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Your
    personal computer has an internal clock, which returns the time and date to your
    computer's operating system. Your computer's Basic Input/Output System or &quot;BIOS&quot;
    is the intermediary between the real-time clock (hardware) and the operating system
    (software). The year-portion of the date is currently represented in the clock's year
    register as &quot;19.&quot; In older (generally, non-Pentium) PCs, the year register in
    the real-time clock may not be able to roll over from &quot;19&quot; to &quot;20&quot; at
    the end of this century. Depending upon the real-time clock, the BIOS, and the operating
    system, your computer may or may not set the time/date correctly on January 1, 2000.</font></font><big>
    </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">The
    real-time clock and BIOS can be tested using one of several available test packages. Two
    are listed in the Internet Resources section below (Check 2000 from Greenwich Mean Time
    and The RighTime Clock Company). Additionally, Norton Year 2000 is widely available. These
    test packages check your PC's real-time clock, BIOS, and operating system and provide
    information regarding required remediation. This may be as simple as resetting the year
    register in the real-time clock or may require a BIOS upgrade. If you have a small number
    of PCs in your office environment, this is relatively easy to do. If there are a large
    number of PCs, more time will be required to &quot;fix&quot; noncompliant PCs.</font></font><big>
    </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">User-configured
    PC software, such as Excel spreadsheet templates, may contain dates with the year
    represented in two characters. These templates may produce incorrect data after the end of
    this year. They can be checked for compliant equations using Visual Audit from Astratek
    (see Internet Resources below).</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif"><b>What
    Contingency Planning Should I Carry Out?</b></font></font><big> </big></font><font
    FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" color="#000000" size="3">In general, significant failures
    in the nation's infrastructure are highly unlikely. Power and other utilities,
    transportation, banks, and insurance companies are unlikely to have major problems. The
    Gartner Group, one of the nation's premier sources of information regarding computer
    systems, expects only &quot;brief glitches and data loses.&quot; They suggest that most
    Y2K-related problems will be brief with only 10% of failures lasting longer than 3 days.
    They suggest, however, that only 8% of disruptions will occur on January 1, 2000, with
    others occurring later this year and others on into 2000. Most disruptions will be easily
    recognized. Jones (Artemis Management Systems) suggests that half of failures will cause
    the system to stop, while another 40% will cause the system to run obviously incorrectly.
    The other 10% or so of problems will be subtler, often associated with data corruption,
    which will be more difficult to detect and fix.</font><font color="#000000"><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Despite
    your best efforts, there may be some things that you know are not compliant and that,
    therefore, may fail to operate correctly. The more likely problems will come from systems
    you believe are compliant but that fail to operate correctly. Contingency planning is
    therefore essential. (See the Mitre website in Internet Resources section below.)</font></font><big>
    </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">Contingency
    is really a business continuity issue: if computers and systems fail, how will you provide
    patient care, continue to support care with your office operations, and recover from any
    financial system failures?</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">In the last
    week of December 1999, make complete backup copies of all of your practice management
    system and accounts receivable files. Normally, backup tapes are reused. Preserve the end
    of 1999 backup tapes until there is no doubt that your office systems are functioning
    correctly. Print your appointment schedule and medical record pull slips for the month of
    January. Plan what back-up systems you will use if office practice management software
    fails. Increase your normal inventories of key pharmaceuticals and office supplies so that
    you can function through January if supply deliveries are interrupted.</font></font><big> </big></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif">It is
    prudent to document everything manually in December 1999 and January 2000. Maintain logs
    and records of all financial transactions. Send significant payments certified, return
    receipt requested. Review your available credit and increase it if necessary to cover
    payment delays. Review all maintenance and service contracts and contact service providers
    to understand their coverage and availability in the event of failures. Know how to get
    help in the event that your practice management or billing system has problems. Plan
    staffing at the end of the year so that key people can be reached if systems fail. Above
    all, increase your surveillance as the year draws to a close and the new year begins.</font></font><big>
    </big></font></p>

    </font><font FACE="Times, Times Roman, serif" color="#000000" size="3">Time is running
    out. With only about half of 1999 remaining, there is little time left before your systems
    will be tested with the January 1, 2000, date. As the consequences of noncompliance are
    uncertain, it is important for you to be as ready as possible.</font><font color="#000000"><big>
