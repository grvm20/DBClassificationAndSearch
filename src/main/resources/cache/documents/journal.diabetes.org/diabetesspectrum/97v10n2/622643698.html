        mellitus is the seventh leading cause of death in the
        United States and is widely prevalent in American
        society, affecting nearly 16 million people, or 6% of the
        U.S. adult population.<sup>1</sup> Moreover, it is
        estimated that 7.2% of all hospitalizations in the United
        States involve diabetes, with more than 20% of these
        because of peripheral vascular disease and its related
        tissue damage in the lower extremities.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Nearly 50% of
        all nontraumatic lower extremity amputations performed in
        the United States are due to diabetes, with an annual
        incidence of 37&#150;137 per 10,000 patients with this
        disease.<sup>1</sup> Of these amputations, 9% are of a
        foot, 31% are of the lower leg, and 30% are at or above
        the knee.<sup>4</sup> Ipsilateral higher amputations
        occur in 22% of cases. Contralateral amputations occur at
        a rate of 10% per year. After 5 years, amputees with
        diabetes have a 50% chance of bilateral amputation, often
        due to increased wear on the remaining limb. At any given
        time, perhaps 1 million patients with diabetes suffer
        from lower extremity ulcers. Wounds of the lower
        extremities are thus one of the major complications of
        diabetes, resulting in substantial morbidity and
        mortality.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">The personal and
        economic costs of this problem are staggering. The cost
        of a primary amputation in 1986 dollars was reported to
        be more than $40,000.<sup>5</sup> Current Medicare
        reimbursement for primary amputation is approximately
        $10,000.<sup>6</sup> Sixty-eight percent of elderly
        amputees will be alive after 4 years, and only
        40&#150;50% will be successfully rehabilitated<sup>7,8</sup>
        The length of hospital stay for primary amputation varies
        widely but has been reported to range from 22 to 40 days.<sup>3,9</sup>
        Six to nine months may be necessary to maximize walking
        ability.10 Rehabilita-tion costs can add an additional
        $40,000&#150;50,000.<sup>11</sup> The total cost of
        amputation due to diabetes in the United States is nearly
        $1.5 billion per year.<sup>11</sup> Readmission within 2
        years for stump modification or re-amputation may
        represent an additional $1 billion expenditure.<sup>11</sup></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Primary
        amputation is far from an expeditious solution to the
        problem of foot wounds, particularly in patients with
        diabetes. The U.S. Department of Health has set a goal of
        reducing the amputation rate among patients with diabetes
        by 40% by 2000.<sup>12</sup> Any treatment modality that
        would substantially reduce the morbidity of diabetic
        lower extremity wounds would have a profound effect on
        health-care costs. An aggressive, multidisciplinary team
        approach to diabetic foot management, in which patients
        are seen by appropriate specialists and undergo
        aggressive revascularization when indicated, has resulted
        in improved salvage and a significant cost benefit.<sup>11,13</sup></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><strong>Pathophysiology
        of <br>
        Diabetic Foot Wounds</strong><br>
        The diabetic foot is characterized by sensorimotor and
        autonomic neuropathies that lead to alteration of
        pressure distribution, foot deformities, and ulceration.
        The classical <em>mal perforans</em> ulcer is caused by
        loss of sensation and painless trauma. This can occur in
        the absence of ischemia and frequently heals with
        conservative measures, such as aggressive wound
        management and unweighting. Primary management is
        directed to patient education and foot care. Autonomic
        neuropathy may cause alterations in blood flow, resulting
        in islands of cutaneous ischemia.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">In patients with
        large-vessel obstruction, the mechanism of wound
        development is clear, and only the restoration of
        pulsatile blood flow will allow adequate healing.
        However, some patients with diabetes who have
        large-vessel perfusion and palpable pulses will still
        develop wounds that appear to be hypoxic/ischemic and
        will fail to heal.<sup>15,16</sup> In these cases, the
        mechanism of wound development is less clear.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Even in the
        presence of palpable pulses, patients with diabetes can
        have areas of low flow and hypoxia in their feet and
        ankles. Contributing factors may include increased blood
        viscosity, increased platelet aggregation, and
        accelerated capillary endothelial growth.<sup>17-19</sup>
        Capillary wall hyalinization can lead to capillary
        obstruction,<sup>20,21</sup> and capillary hyperperfusion
        and vasodilatation can lead to injury via subendothelial
        deposition of macromolecules.<sup>19</sup> Additionally,
        patients with diabetes respond to local tissue stresses
        through thrombosis and necrosis, as opposed to the
        inflammatory response that occurs in the nondiabetic
        population.<sup>22</sup> Regardless of the mechanism
        involved, the net result is focal hypoxia that can
        involve regions of the ankle, foot, or toes.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Investigators
        believe that tight control of blood glucose concentration
        may slow or even reverse this pathological process, and
        periodic elevation of tissue oxygen tensions can also
        favorably influence this process. Surgical
        revascularization, particularly with <em>in situ</em>
        vein grafts, can frequently provide the necessary
        substrate for wound healing. However, in some cases,
        wound-healing failure occurs despite restored
        circulation. This suggests a problem with the
        wound-healing process itself, and indeed, defective wound
        healing has been demonstrated to be a major factor in the
        nonhealing diabetic ulcer.<sup>23</sup></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><strong>The
        Wound-Healing Process</strong><br>
        The wound-healing process is a complicated one and is
        initiated by a complex series of events that include
        chemoattraction, growth-factor pathways, complement
        generation, and the energy-poor environments created by
        low oxygen tensions, low pH, and high lactate
        concentrations.<sup>24</sup> Macrophages attracted to
        such environments release lactate aerobically, as well as
        anaerobically, and generate potent growth factors,
        resulting in brisk angiogenesis and multiplication of
        fibroblasts at wound margins. These events can take place
        in a low-oxygen environment. However, the modification of
        collagen by fibroblasts so that it can be polymerized and
        secreted into the extracellular space can be accomplished
        only when oxygen is present at high partial pressures.
        Therefore, collagen is deposited most rapidly when both
        lactate and oxygen concentrations are high. The need for
        oxygen persists well into the healing process, since new
        collagen must be deposited as old collagen is lysed.
        Production and remodeling must be in balance if wounds
        are to maintain tensile strength.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">The mechanisms
        of oxygen enhancement of wound healing involve the
        hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in
        procollagen. As mentioned above, these hydroxylation
        processes are necessary for polymerization and
        cross-linkage of procollagen strands and the transport of
        collagen molecules to the extracellular space. This
        process proceeds at one-half maximal rate at a PO2
        (partial pressure of oxygen) of 20 mmHg and at 90%
        maximal rate at 200 mmHg.<sup>25</sup> Thus, collagen
        deposition, the process that fills tissue defects and
        supports new blood vessels, proceeds in proportion to
        tissue oxygen levels.<sup>26</sup> Cell replication also
        requires oxygen. Fibroblasts and vascular endothelial
        cells replicate most rapidly at a PO<sub>2</sub> of 40
        mmHg; epidermal cells may replicate best at 700 mmHg.<sup>27</sup></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Leukocytes kill
        most effectively when supplied with abundant oxygen,<sup>28</sup>
        as their most effective killing is accomplished through
        the oxidative pathway. This mechanism is most efficient
        in high oxygen concentrations and fails rapidly as tissue
        oxygen tensions fall below 30&#150;40 mmHg. Therefore,
        susceptibility to infection increases as tissue oxygen
        tensions decrease. Accordingly, wounds of the extremities
        are often infected, while infections are rare in those
        tissues that have higher flow and higher tissue oxygen
        tensions, such as in the face, tongue, and anal area.
        Similarly, well perfused and oxygenated flaps are
        resistant to infection and infectious gangrene, whereas
        random flaps, which have low oxygen tensions in their
        distal portions (analogous to the situation noted in the
        diabetic foot), are susceptible to infection and suffer a
        high degree of infectious necrosis.<sup>29-32</sup>
        Oxidative killing is an important aspect of wound healing
        and is additive to the effect of appropriate antibiotics.<sup>33,34</sup>
        Periodic oxygen administration to elevate PO<sub>2</sub>
        above 100 mmHg enhances this process.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Angiogenesis is
        a fundamental requirement of healing, and the
        observations of Rohr and associates demonstrate the
        importance of oxygen in this process and are compatible
        with clinical observations of accelerated angiogenesis
        using oxygen at pressure.<sup>35</sup> Angiogenesis
        occurs most rapidly when it proceeds from a high oxygen
        tension to a low one and from a low-lactate environment
        to a high one.<sup>24,36</sup> The data of Marx and
        associates<sup>36</sup> and Knighton and associates<sup>24</sup>
        suggest that angiogenesis is proportional to the gradient
        of PO<sub>2</sub> from capillary to wound space (i.e., a
        high tissue oxygen tension at the periphery of a wound
        and a low tissue oxygen tension at its center enhances
        angiogenesis). Therefore, restoration of PO<sub>2</sub>
        to normal or supranormal levels enhances not only
        epithelialization, fibroplasia, collagen deposition, and
        bacterial killing, but also capillary proliferation and
        advancement into the wound space.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><strong>Principles
        of Hyperbaric <br>
        Oxygen Therapy<br>
        </strong>The Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, an
        international scientific organization and the leading
        authority for diving and hyperbaric medicine in the
        United States, defines hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) as
        the intermittent administration of 100% oxygen in-haled
        at a pressure greater than sea level. (Topical oxygen
        therapy rendered in small limb-encasing devices is not
        considered HBO and has been demonstrated to be
        ineffective. It may, in fact, decrease oxygen delivery to
        affected limbs.<sup>37,38</sup>)</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">HBO is not new,
        having been used since 1943.<sup>39</sup> Modern therapy
        dates to the early 1960s, when Dutch investigators
        demonstrated the efficacy of HBO in gas gangrene and
        anemic states.<sup>40,41</sup> HBO is presently used as
        primary treatment for decompression illness (the bends),
        air embolisms, and severe carbon monoxide poisoning.<sup>42-44</sup>
        Adjunc-tive indications include clostridial myonecrosis,
        crush injury and traumatic ischemias, enhancement of
        healing in selected problem wounds, necrotizing soft
        tissue infections, chronic refractory osteomyelitis,
        radiation damage to soft or hard tissue, compromised skin
        grafts or flaps, and thermal burns. All of these
        conditions share a common pathophysiology of local or
        focal hypoxia.<sup>36,45-66</sup></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">HBO is designed
        to increase oxygen delivery to local ischemic tissue and,
        by a variety of primary and secondary mechanisms, to
        facilitate wound healing. It is a physiological process,
        in which a patient breathes 100% oxygen intermittently
        while the pressure of the external environment is
        increased to a greater-than-normal-sea-level pressure,
        usually 2.0&#150;2.4 atmospheres absolute (ATA) or
        33&#150;45 feet of sea water (fsw). HBO may be
        implemented in a walk-in (multiplace) chamber, compressed
        to depth with air while the patient breathes 100% oxygen
        with a head tent, face mask, or endotracheal tube, or,
        alternatively, the patient may be treated in a one-person
        (monoplace) chamber pressurized to depth with oxygen. In
        either case, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen will
        approach 1,500 mmHg at the pressure equivalent of 33 fsw
        (10 m, or 2 ATA).</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">At normal
        atmospheric pressures, most of the oxygen in blood is
        carried by hemoglobin, with minimal additional oxygen
        dissolved in the plasma. By giving high concentrations of
        oxygen under increased pressure (2.0&#150; 2.4 ATA), the
        dissolved oxygen in the blood can be significantly
        increased, resulting in an ~30% increase in
        oxygen-carrying capacity. These levels of dissolved
        oxygen have been shown to maintain life in the absence of
        hemoglobin.<sup>40</sup> At a standard treatment pressure
        of 2.4 ATA, an arterial PO<sub>2</sub> of 1500 mmHg can
        be achieved, which increases the driving pressure for
        diffusion of oxygen into the tissue and increases the
        diffusion distance by three- to fourfold.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">HBO protocols
        vary depending on the severity of the situation. In the
        absence of infection, HBO once per day at 2.0&#150;2.4
        ATA for 90&#150;120 minutes is sufficient to stimulate
        wound healing. In the presence of infection or a high
        risk of limb loss, treatment twice per day is
        recommended. Even though treatment sessions are
        relatively brief, oxygen tensions may remain elevated in
        subcutaneous tissue for several hours after exposure.<sup>67-69</sup></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">By increasing
        tissue oxygen levels, HBO can attack the deleterious
        effects that hypoxia has on wound healing. The exact
        mechanism by which this is accomplished is not yet fully
        understood. However, there is evidence that suggests that
        HBO stimulates angiogenesis. Sheffield has demonstrated
        improvement in capillaries, measuring transcutaneous
        oxygen over healing tissue in the diabetic foot, and has
        clearly documented the slow improvement in blood flow
        over the first 3 weeks of HBO, as evidenced by rising
        tissue oxygen tensions.<sup>70</sup> This is particularly
        true during HBO sessions. Marx has shown similar changes
        in ischemic irradiated tissue.<sup>36</sup></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman"><strong>Studies
        Investigating the <br>
        Efficacy of HBO</strong><br>
        Numerous retrospective studies have shown the efficacy of
        HBO. Davis reviewed a clinical series of 168 patients
        with compromised refractory diabetic foot wounds treated
        over a 7-year period.<sup>71 </sup>Utilizing the
        parameter of limb salvage, a success rate of 70% was
        obtained. Thirty percent failed to respond and required
        amputation above or below the knee. Failures were most
        common in older individuals without palpable pedal pulses
        and with large-vessel occlusion at or above the ankle
        diagnosed by angiography. Cianci treated 19 patients with
        diabetes in a subset of 39 lower extremity lesions in
        1988, with a salvage rate of 89%.<sup>11</sup> Forty-two
        percent of these patients had undergone successful
        revascularization and were referred because of persistent
        infection or nonhealing wounds. Salvage was defined as
        bipedal ambulation if two limbs were originally present
        and intact wound coverage remaining for at least 1 year.
        HBO costs were $12,668 and were reflected in total
        hospital charges of $34,370, with an average length of
        stay of 35 days.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">More recently,
        another series of 41 patients with diabetes, who averaged
        63 years in age, was analyzed.<sup>72</sup> Thirty-nine
        patients (97%) were suffering limb-threatening lesions.
        Fifty-five percent of the patients had undergone
        revascularization. An average Wagner score of 4,
        indicating gangrene of the toes or forefoot, was
        obtained. Thirty-one patients (78%) had their lower
        extremities salvaged. HBO charges in this series were
        $15,900, total hospital charges were $32,000, and the
        average length of stay was 27 days, which compare
        favorably with the cost of primary amputation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Avoidance of
        rehabilitation costs and the additional savings involved
        in prevention of re-amputation or stump revision has been
        an additional benefit. The follow-up of these patients
        over 1-6 years (average of 30 months) has shown a 92%
        durability; that is, ambulation without further lesions
        or problems. Two of the patients have suffered
        below-the-knee amputations.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">In 1992, Oriani
        reported a 10-year experience that showed 80% salvage in
        a group that received HBO versus 40% in controls (P &lt;
        0.001).<sup>73</sup> Initial treatment of 15 sessions and
        reevaluation was recommended, as significant improvement
        in wound healing should be apparent at that time. If
        improvement was noted, treatment was continued for an
        additional 10 sessions. If absent, HBO was discontinued.
        Gismondi has noted the importance of careful, aggressive
        debridement and meticulous wound care in reducing
        hospital stay, the number of HBO treatments, and
        ultimately, cost of care.<sup>74</sup></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">In 1993&#150;94,
        a pilot study was undertaken to examine the results of
        hyperbaric oxygen therapy in patients with diabetes seen
        at our centers. Data were collected in a retrospective
        manner utilizing 1,633 consecutive patients who were
        treated in our Dallas clinics over a 33-month period
        (March 1992 through November 1994). Five hundred and one
        patients (31%) presenting with diabetes and ischemic
        wounds were identified by diagnosis codes and confirmed
        by chart review. Patients were grouped by treatment
        modality: hyperbaric oxygen therapy (n = 119) versus
        conservative treatment alone (n = 382), which was
        administered according to the clinical judgment of the
        treating physician. Limb salvage (defined as bipedal
        ambulation if two limbs were present) was used as the
        endpoint for the study.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Hyperbaric
        treatment consisted of oxygen therapy delivered at an
        individualized rate, duration, and ATA for each patient.
        Complete follow-up was available on 73% (87 of 119) of
        the patients receiving hyperbaric oxygen. Some patients
        were referred from outside centers, and, therefore, their
        records were unavailable for review (n = 32).</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Conservative
        treatment was based on the standard of care and
        individualized to include, if necessary:

        Patients referred for HBO had larger wounds (mean � SE
        area: 2,533 � 987 vs. 1,199 � 61 mm<sup>3</sup>, P =
        0.18), more wounds per patient (3.8 vs. 2.4, P &lt;
        0.0001), and a greater percentage recommended for
        amputation (31% vs. 19%, P = 0.002). Despite having the
        more serious wounds, the limb salvage rate was greater in
        the HBO patients (72% vs. 53%, P &lt; 0.002).</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">The results of
        multiple other retrospective studies involving
        approximately 500 patients have been consistent and
        indicate a 70&#150;90% success rate in patients who had
        been refractory to other modes of therapy, with success
        defined as the avoidance of amputation and, in many
        cases, complete wound healing.<sup>76-79</sup></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">Baroni and
        associates prospectively treated 28 patients, 18 of whom
        received HBO.<sup>80</sup> Unfortunately, the patients
        were not randomized. They were placed in the control
        group if they had claustrophobia, ischemic heart disease,
        paresthesia, or were felt to be unmotivated. All patients
        received daily debridement of ulcers to bleeding tissue
        with removal of necrotic tissue. Physicians performing
        the debridements were blinded to group assignment.
        Sixteen of the 18 patients (89%) in the treatment group
        completely healed and remained healed at a follow-up of
        1-36 months (13.5 � 10.1). Only one (10%) of the
        patients in the control group healed. The amputation rate
        was 12.5% in the treated group versus 40% in the control
        group (P &lt; 0.001). The HBO patients were sufficiently
        improved to be discharged in 62 days, and 16 completely
        healed. Nine of ten of the control group had not healed
        82 days later.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">In a follow-up
        study in 1990, 62 of 80 patients (78%) received a course
        of HBO.<sup>81</sup> Ninety-six percent of the HBO
        patients went on to heal versus 66% of the control group.
        The amputation rate in the HBO group was 4.8% versus 33%
        in the control group (P &lt; 0.001). The incidence of
        amputation in the untreated group was essentially
        unchanged from a group of patients treated nearly 10
        years earlier without the benefit of adjunctive HBO.
        There were no statistical differences in any of the
        groups relating to age, glycemic control, or diabetes
        complications.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">In a recently
        reported study, individuals with diabetes with nonhealing
        foot ulcers were consecutively admitted to a hospital for
        treatment.<sup>82</sup> They were randomly assigned to
        either an HBO group or a control group. Two individuals,
        one in each group, did not complete the protocol and were
        excluded from analyses. A total of 35 individuals
        received HBO. Three (8.6%) of them underwent major
        amputation (the outcome variable) versus eleven (33.3%)
        in the nonHBO group (P = 0.016). The relative risk for
        the treated group was 0.26 (95% CI 0.08&#150;0.84).
        Multivariate analysis confirmed the protective role of
        HBO (odds ratio 0.084, P = 0.033, 95% CI
        0.008&#150;0.821) and indicated as negative prognostic
        determinants low ankle-brachial index values (odds ratio
        1.715, P = 0.013, 95% CI 1.121&#150; 2.626) and high
        Wagner grade (odds ratio 11.199, P = 0.022, 95% CI
        1.406&#150;89.146).</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">To our
        knowledge, there has been only one double-blind,
        prospective, randomized study investigating the utility
        of HBO, which was performed in nondiabetic patients with
        chronic leg wounds.<sup>83</sup> Individuals receiving
        HBO had a 35.7% (SD � 17%) reduction in wound size at 6
        weeks compared with 2.7% (SD � 11%) in control subjects
        (P &lt; 0.001).</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">These studies
        indicate that HBO is an effective method for treating
        diabetic foot wounds in carefully selected cases of lower
        extremity lesions. They support the recommendation that
        HBO should be considered as an adjunct to wound healing
        and as part of multidisciplinary wound care. Additional
        studies to further define the role of HBO are underway.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York,Times New Roman">One such study,
        funded by the American Diabetes Association, is in
        progress at our institution.<sup>84</sup> This study will
        employ a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled,
        double-blind design. All patients will receive standard
        wound care, which includes but is not limited to
        revascularization, offloading, glycemic control,
        infection control, debridements, and education and
        lifestyle modification. In addition, patients will be
        randomized into two groups: the treatment group (HBO) and
        the control group (no HBO). Both groups will receive
        treatment at 2.4 ATA (45 fsw) for a period of 100
        minutes. The HBO group will be receiving 100% oxygen
        during the breathing periods. The control patients will
        be exposed to the same hyperbaric environment, but will
        breathe a gas mixture equivalent to breathing air on the
        surface. We hypothesize that a defined course of
        intermittent increased tissue concentrations of oxygen
        will result in: <em>1)</em> reduction in amputation rate;
        <em>2)</em> increase in number of wounds that are
        completely healed; and <em>3)</em> more rapid healing
        rates. The study will also evaluate whether there are
        specific subgroups of patients with diabetic wounds who
        will benefit most from HBO. This patient population will
        be analyzed according to age, objective evidence of
        adequacy of limb perfusion (severely compromised,
        moderately compromised, and preserved), presence or
        absence of peripheral neuropathy, and glycemic control.</font></p>
