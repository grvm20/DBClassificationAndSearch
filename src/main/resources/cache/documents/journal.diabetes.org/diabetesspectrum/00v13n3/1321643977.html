    </div><div><p><font size="5"><strong>C</strong></font><font size="3">arbohydrate counting
    is a useful approach to meal planning for competitive or casual athletes. Consider the
    following two examples. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3"><strong>Case #1 <br>
    </strong>R.J. is 25 years old and has had type 1 diabetes for 6 years. About 3 years ago,
    he went on an insulin pump and has been using carbohydrate counting to determine his
    insulin boluses. His current carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio is 10 g of carbohydrate for 1 U
    of insulin. An avid runner for approximately 5 years, R.J. usually reduces his insulin
    dosages on training and competition days. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">R.J. currently averages 25&#150;30 miles of
    running per week. He has competed in several 5- and 10-kilometer races and has decided he
    would like to begin competing in marathons. He needs assistance with how to modify his
    food intake as he increases his mileage for training, as well as how to consume
    carbohydrate during a marathon. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">During R.J.'s daily training, he is
    consuming 8&#150;10 g carbohydrate/kg body weight/day. During the week before the
    marathon, he is doing a modified glycogen supercompensation plan described below that
    results in carbohydrate consumption between 5&#150;10 g carbohydrate/kg body weight/ day
    with a tapering exercise duration. Carbohydrate intake during the marathon is between 40
    and 65 g/hour, and within 24 hours after the marathon, R.J. resumes his intake of
    8&#150;10 g carbohydrate/kg body weight /day. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose is
    imperative to make necessary adjustments in carbohydrate intake and/or insulin. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3"><strong>Case #2 <br>
    </strong>S.H. is 16 years old and has had type 1 diabetes for 3 years. She is currently on
    three injections of insulin per day and is trying to follow a general &quot;healthy
    eating&quot; meal plan that she was given at diagnosis. She is on her high school soccer
    team and has after-school workouts or competitive matches 5 days per week. She also has
    periodic matches on weekends. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">S.H. needs assistance with learning to make
    any necessary adjustments in food intake during soccer practice and competitions. In
    addition, she would benefit from reassessment of her current meal plan and learning how to
    count carbohydrate. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">The carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio that S.H.
    found worked the best was 15 g of carbohydrate for 1 U of insulin. She consumes
    approximately 75 g of carbohydrate at each meal with additional carbohydrate immediately
    before, during, and/or after soccer games depending upon blood glucose readings and
    anticipated playing time. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">The patients described above are examples of
    the athletes typically seen in my work as an exercise physiologist and dietitian. While my
    clinical work in diabetes has certainly not consisted solely of diabetic athletes, working
    with those who are increasing their level of exercise is very common. Since work with
    competitive or recreational athletes who have diabetes, like other special populations,
    requires some specialized knowledge, I also have several opportunities to consult on
    patients being seen by colleagues. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">When beginning to work with diabetic
    patients who are currently participating in athletic events or who are planning to do so,
    it is imperative to do a thorough initial assessment. The first patient visit is done as
    an individual appointment that lasts for about 45 minutes because it is necessary to get
    detailed information about the athlete that is best accomplished in a one-on-one setting.
    This assessment, as for any patient, must include a review of the patient's history that
    identifies any medical concerns (e.g., serious episodes of hypoglycemia, presence of any
    chronic complications), review of labs, current blood glucose monitoring frequency and
    results, and dosage and timing of medications (including carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio if
    currently using an intensive insulin regimen).<sup>1 </sup></font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">At the initial visit, a thorough food and
    exercise recall is also taken. Patients are asked to describe what they are currently
    doing in as much detail as possible. It is not uncommon for those who are involved in
    competitive athletic events to bring written records about their training regimens to the
    initial visit. If these records are available, they are discussed with the patient to be
    sure the information is complete. It is important to get information about both training
    and competitions. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">For patients already using carbohydrate
    counting as their nutrition tool, such as R.J. in case #1, a brief practice session is
    conducted using food models to determine where they stand with estimating food portions.
    It is important to assess their current ability since this is a critical skill for
    successful carbohydrate counting. An assessment is also done of their ability to read and
    use food label information and where they turn for carbohydrate information if a label is
    not accessible. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Depending on a patient's skill level in
    these areas, more work may be done on these at the next individual appointment or in a
    class setting. It is often desirable to teach and practice label reading and carbohydrate
    estimating in a group setting because patients can learn from and reinforce each other. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">For patients who do not use carbohydrate
    counting, such as S.H. in case #2, it is important to determine if they use any nutrition
    approach and, if so, how well it is working. While carbohydrate counting is not the tool
    for everyone, it is a very useful approach for athletes because of the need for
    significant flexibility with training and competitions. If an athlete is amenable, the
    basics of carbohydrate counting (e.g., what foods contain carbohydrate, where to get
    carbohydrate information) are taught at the first visit, and an initial
    carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio is established based on the patient's nutrition and exercise
    history. At subsequent appointments, blood glucose records are used to assess and modify
    the carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio, and opportunities to refine skills in estimating
    carbohydrate portions are provided. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Carbohydrate counting for athletes has
    application in several settings: during daily training, for the week before a competitive
    event, in the preceding hours before competition, during competition, and in the 24 hours
    after competition.<sup>2</sup> For each of these time periods, appropriate carbohydrate
    and insulin dosages must be determined to maximize performance and keep blood glucose
    levels within the patient's therapeutic goals. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">In addition to refining skills in
    carbohydrate counting, the subsequent appointment(s) are spent carefully reviewing
    training, blood glucose, and food records to help athletes achieve their competitive and
    blood glucose goals. A variety of other topics are also discussed that have relevance to
    food and athletic performance and may include such issues as use of and response to sports
    bars and carbohydrate beverages. Diabetic athletes can derive important benefits from the
    use of sports bars and carbohydrate beverages since supplemental carbohydrate is often
    necessary to maintain exercise intensity and, for those with diabetes, to prevent and/or
    treat hypoglycemia. The follow-up with patients is often accomplished via telephone and
    fax, particularly as the competition draws closer, when more frequent contact is
    desirable. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">The expectations for what patients should
    know as a result of education sessions depends on their initial knowledge and skill level.
    Athletes who already have fairly high carbohydrate counting knowledge and skills should be
    better able to apply that knowledge to a wider array of circumstances, such as increasing
    mileage during a training session or in variable competition settings. When carbohydrate
    counting is being taught to athletes for the first time, it is important that they can
    successfully identify carbohydrate-containing foods and work to fine-tune their
    carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">It is important for all athletes to keep
    careful records so that we can work together to increase their ability to make decisions
    in the variable situations in which they find themselves. For all athletes, a great deal
    of trial and error occurs as they work to balance food and exercise. It is therefore
    important to reinforce good efforts and sound logic used as athletes work to compete and
    keep diabetes in balance. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">The primary advantage for using carbohydrate
    counting with athletes is the flexibility it provides. It is necessary to have a nutrition
    approach that helps diabetic athletes meet treatment goals and allows significant
    flexibility due to the variety of circumstances that can arise while training and
    certainly while competing. By using a technique that can be applied in numerous settings,
    athletes can learn the necessary skills for carbohydrate counting and then modify the
    specific application of this information as they train and compete. When compared to other
    nutrition approaches, carbohydrate counting provides a greater degree of accuracy for
    making insulin dosage adjustments. This is also a very important advantage for athletes
    because they must have adequate fuel available for increased activity level, while at the
    same time prevent hypo- and hyperglycemia. Because of the more complex set of
    circumstances seen in athletic events (stress of competition, variable timing of
    competitive events, and duration of energy expenditure), use of a nutrition approach that
    allows the greatest accuracy available is recommended. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Every nutrition approach has its limitations
    because food issues are often the most complex and challenging that patients face. If
    carbohydrate counting is to be done with the greatest accuracy possible (which is not
    perfection), it is important to learn to accurately estimate portions. This is a skill
    that many find to be very challenging and one that requires practice. In addition, if a
    food label is not available, it is necessary to determine the amount of carbohydrate in
    the serving using other sources of nutrition information that may not be readily available
    (e.g., food lists). Another challenge with carbohydrate counting is the use of
    calculations to determine the units of insulin needed for a given amount of carbohydrate.
    This can pose difficulties for patients. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">While these features of carbohydrate
    counting can be considered limitations by many, including athletes, they are outweighed by
    the advantages. The flexibility provided by carbohydrate counting is a necessity when
    working to achieve success in athletic endeavors and maintain appropriate blood glucose
    control. The limitations of carbohydrate counting are likely to be less limiting for
    athletes since they may be more accustomed to performing calculations, estimating food
    quantities, and keeping careful records as a part of training for athletic events. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Teaching strategies that can be helpful when
    working with athletes provide patients with opportunities to apply their knowledge and
    skills. Creating food choice scenarios based on patient experience (obtained from the
    history) that are worked through together helps prepare patients to troubleshoot on their
    own. For example, one could ask an athlete who is preparing for a marathon what he will do
    3 days before the event to help increase glycogen levels while working to keep his blood
    glucose in check. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">It is important to caution athletes with
    diabetes about using glycogen supercompensation regimens. A strategy reported by Sherman
    et al.<sup>2</sup> incorporates dietary manipulation and tapering of exercise duration 6
    days before the competition to achieve glycogen supercompensation. During the first 3
    days, the diet should contain 5 g carbohydrate/kg body weight/day, and during the last 3
    days, 8&#150;10 g carbohydrate/kg/body weight/day. Moderate exercise should be done at
    diminishing duration of 90, 40, 40, 20, 20, 0 minutes over the 6 days. This regimen
    increases muscle glycogen to more than 210 mmol/kg wet wt. (approximately 1.6-fold above
    usual glycogen concentration). </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">It is also important to discuss what food
    choices will be made within the hours preceding exercise. One study demonstrated that a
    low-glycemic- index meal (totaling 1.5 g carbohydrate/kg body weight) produced
    significantly higher plasma glucose levels, lower insulin levels and ratings of perceived
    exertion, and 59% longer time to exhaustion than a high- glycemic-index meal.<sup>3</sup>
    This study was not conducted in those with diabetes, so the application to this special
    population is unknown. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">These practice scenarios also let clinicians
    see if patients' logic is sound and allows reinforcement of information that patients need
    to make appropriate decisions. The records kept by patients on food intake, training
    schedules, blood glucose monitoring, and insulin dosages are especially important for
    athletes. A greater degree of information is necessary when working with this special
    population in order to help patients exercise safely and achieve their athletic goals. It
    is imperative that patients make a commitment to keeping good records and that clinicians
    and patients use this information to guide carbohydrate decisions. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Although not a teaching strategy provided
    directly by clinicians, it is important to help athletes with diabetes communicate with
    each other and share information. This can be accomplished by giving patients information
    about the International Diabetic Athletes Association and, if available, local contacts
    that patients can talk to about shared experiences. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Diabetes and athletic performance is an area
    in need of further research. The studies done on carbohydrate loading and other strategies
    for optimizing athletic performance, carbohydrate/fluid replenishment during exercise, and
    nutritional strategies in the hours following training or competition have been primarily,
    if not exclusively, done in nondiabetic subjects. Data that have direct application to
    those with diabetes would be helpful in giving clearer direction to diabetic athletes.
    While most of the population will not choose to participate in competitive athletic
    events, it is very important that we encourage our patients to be more physically active.
    A better understanding of metabolic responses to and nutrition interventions for exercise
    in athletes with diabetes will provide important information with relevance to
    recreational and competitive athletes alike. </font></p>
