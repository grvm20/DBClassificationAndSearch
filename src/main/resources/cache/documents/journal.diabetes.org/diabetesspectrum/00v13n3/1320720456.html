    is an effective medical nutrition therapy option for adults with type 2 diabetes. This
    meal planning tool has increased in popularity as a result of research demonstrating the
    benefits of intensive therapy in individuals with type 1 diabetes.<sup>1</sup> It can also
    lead to improved diabetes control and weight loss in adults with type 2 diabetes. This
    article describes our experience in teaching carbohydrate counting in a diabetes specialty
    practice using &quot;carbohydrate homework.&quot; </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">In my full-time practice with an
    endocrinologist and diabetologist, I see a large population of patients with type 2
    diabetes. Nutrition services are provided in one-to-one consultations, and 8&#150;12
    patients are seen per day. Our type 2 diabetes population spans the spectrum in terms of
    educational and socioeconomic level. Whether working or retired, many eat the majority of
    their meals out or on the run, because their spouse has died, their children are grown, or
    busy lifestyles don't allow for meals at home. Most have a misconception of the role
    nutrition plays in their diabetes control. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">When patients enter our practice, they often
    express frustration with their lack of glycemic control, lack of success with weight loss,
    and continuing problems with weight gain. Patients report frustration that, although they
    are following a meal plan and their premeal blood glucose levels are close to target,
    their HbA<sub>lc</sub> levels are still elevated. It is often at this frustration point
    that a patient first meets with the dietitian, and the concept of carbohydrate counting is
    introduced. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Carbohydrate counting with fat- gram
    counting is an effective way to work on weight loss and to improve the control of
    diabetes. Carbohydrate is converted to blood glucose almost 100% within approximately 90
    minutes after the meal.<sup>2</sup> Fat consumption, especially consumption of saturated
    fat, increases insulin resistance<sup>3,4</sup> along with abdominal body fat
    distribution, which is often associated with type 2 diabetes.<sup>5</sup> </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Patients who understand how different
    nutrients affect their blood glucose level may be more receptive to strategies designed to
    improve blood glucose control. Working with patients on an individual basis, I am able to
    tie diabetes management therapies into their daily experience. My first visit usually
    includes an overview of diabetes, the role of medications if they are on any, and the role
    of nutrition and meal planning. One of the most useful tools I have found when working
    with diabetes patients is the post-meal blood glucose level excursion. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">After a discussion of the different
    nutrients, I have patients do what I call &quot;carbohydrate homework.&quot; This involves
    recording nine meals and blood glucose levels pre- and 90 minutes post-meal. Patients
    record their blood glucose levels pre- and post-meal for three different breakfasts, three
    lunches, and three dinners. They also are asked to record the foods they eat, the amount,
    and if possible (depending on the educational capabilities of the patient), the
    carbohydrate grams and the fat grams (Table 1). </font></p>

    with their completed homework, they can determine their own diet prescription. When
    patients see the connection between what they eat and the glycemic response, they are
    usually impressed. Their pre- and post-meal blood glucose levels guide their carbohydrate
    and fat choices and portion sizes. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Postprandial blood glucose levels are vital
    to overall diabetes control. Postprandial blood glucose excursions often cause elevated
    HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels.<sup>6 </sup>Patients may be surprised by the magnitude of these
    excursions. When evaluating the carbohydrate homework, I average the pre- and post-meal
    blood glucose levels for each of the three meal categories. I then average the total
    carbohydrate grams for each of the meals separately and look at the fat consumption. In
    doing the homework assignments, I suggest: </font></p>
    </div><ul>
      <li><div><p><font size="3">First, looking at the patients' average post-meal blood glucose
        compared to their average pre-meal blood glucose level and average consumption of
        carbohydrate for each meal. </font></p>
        </div></li>
      <li><div><p><font size="3">Asking whether restriction of carbohydrate could result in
        improved blood glucose control. </font></p>
        </div></li>
      <li><div><p><font size="3">Being sure to leave patients with a realistic amount of
        carbohydrate for calorie requirements and nutritional balance. </font></p>
        </div></li>
      <li><div><p><font size="3">Evaluating each meal separately, because a person's carbohydrate
        tolerance often varies throughout the day based on activity level and the degree of
        insulin resistance. </font></p>
        </div></li>
    </ul>
    <div><p><font size="3">Many individuals still believe that if they avoid sugar they should
    have no problem controlling their blood glucose levels. The carbohydrate homework shows
    them that all types of carbohydrate count. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">The tools I use to teach carbohydrate-gram
    counting include food labels and carbohydrate exchange lists. For fat-gram counting, I use
    the food labels and a handout on the fat content of foods developed by Nutrition Graphics.
    The food pyramid and the exchange lists facilitate discussion of which foods contain
    specific nutrients. Food models are also useful tools for demonstrating what size portions
    contain specific grams of carbohydrate, fat, and protein. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Most patients find that carbohydrate- and
    fat-gram counting gives them the flexibility they need for family gatherings and special
    occasions. Today's lifestyle often does not allow the three structured meals that were
    common not so long ago. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Carbohydrate-gram counting may be easier to
    use than the traditional exchange lists. However, some patients may be overwhelmed by
    counting carbohydrate and fat grams. With these patients, I may use carbohydrate exchanges
    or possibly the food pyramid to count carbohydrate servings. If a patient is still
    overwhelmed, a structured individualized meal plan outlining what and when to eat is
    developed. The patient is encouraged to use American Diabetes Association/ American
    Dietetic Association cookbooks and the Month of Meals books. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Regardless of the meal planning approach
    selected, the carbohydrate homework is the basis for the meal plans since it provides
    information about carbohydrate tolerance for both the patient and me to use. This homework
    also helps patients understand that sometimes food choices may not be the only reason for
    blood glucose excursions; medication may be required to control blood glucose levels. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">If weight loss is a goal, the carbohydrate
    homework lets patients know precisely how much they are eating, especially if they are
    able to count the grams of carbohydrate. Serving sizes are often distorted, and many
    individuals are often surprised to find out just how many carbohydrate and fat grams they
    are consuming. </font></p>

    </strong>Carbohydrate homework provides professionals the basis for developing a medical
    nutrion care plan that has the potential to improve blood glucose control. It serves as a
    mechanism to assess patients' tolerance to carbohydrate and fat and the need for
    nutritional or pharmacological intervention in the control of type 2 diabetes. Teaching
    patients with type 2 diabetes carbohydrate counting based on their post-meal glucose
    excusions can provide increased flexability with food choices and a means for better blood
    glucose control. </font></p>
