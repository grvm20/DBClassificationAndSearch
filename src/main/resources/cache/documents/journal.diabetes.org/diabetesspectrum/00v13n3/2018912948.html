        size="3">People with diabetes are frequently given advice about protein that has no
        scientific basis. In addition, although weight is lost when individuals follow a
        low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet, there is no evidence that such diets are followed
        long-term or that there is less recidivism than with other low-calorie diets. People with
        type 1 or type 2 diabetes who are in poor metabolic control may have increased protein
        requirements. However, the usual amount of protein consumed by people with diabetes
        adequately compensates for the increased protein catabolism. People with diabetes need
        adequate and accurate information about protein on which to base their food decisions. </font></td>

    the United States, ~16% of the average adult consumption of calories is from protein, and
    this has varied little from 1909 to the present.<sup>1</sup> Protein intake is also fairly
    consistent across all ages from infancy to older age. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">A daily intake of 2,500 calories contributes ~100 g of
    protein&#151;about twice what is needed to replace protein lost on a daily basis. Excess
    amino acids must be converted into other storage products or oxidized as fuel. Therefore,
    in theory, the excess ingested protein could, through the process of gluconeogenesis,
    produce glucose. This would mean that 100 g of protein could produce ~50 g of glucose.
    This has been the basis of the statement that if about half of ingested protein is
    converted to glucose, protein will have one-half the effect of carbohydrate on blood
    glucose levels. However, this belief has been challenged.<sup>2-4</sup> </font></p>

    are they really protein? Certainly, they all contain protein. But most foods that contain
    protein also contain fat, and a few also contain carbohydrate. As illustrated in Tables 1

    ~3.5 g glucose could be produced for every gram of nitrogen excreted in the urine as the
    result of a beef protein meal. Beef protein is 16% nitrogen; thus, 1 g of nitrogen is
    excreted for every 6.25 g protein. Theoretically, then, 56% of ingested beef protein, by
    weight, can be converted to glucose. However, this was only a theoretical calculation.
    Gannon and Nuttall point out that, shortly after that calculation was reported, a number
    of researchers showed that the ingestion of protein by subjects with and without diabetes
    did not result in an increase in blood glucose levels. </font></p>

    Newburgh<sup>5</sup> reported no effect on blood glucose levels after a meal containing a
    large amount of protein in the form of lean beef. Fifteen subjects with diabetes and three
    control subjects were fed breakfasts of glucose or carbohydrate or protein foods
    calculated to yield equal amounts of glucose (2 g protein/kg compared to 1 g
    carbohydrate/kg). The blood glucose response after carbohydrate or glucose was as
    expected. However, there was no increase in blood glucose levels after the protein meal
    even though there was a consistent rise in blood urea nitrogen indicating protein
    utilization. The finding that protein did not raise blood glucose levels seems to have
    been lost or misinterpreted over the years. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">More recently, data from Nuttall et al.<sup>6-9</sup> also
    indicate that peripheral glucose concentration does not increase after protein ingestion
    in subjects with and without diabetes. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Nuttall et al.<sup>10</sup> gave nine subjects with mild type
    2 diabetes 50 g protein, 50 g glucose, or 50 g protein and 50 g glucose and determined the
    plasma glucose and insulin responses over the next 5 hours. The glucose response to
    glucose was as expected, but the glucose response to protein remained stable for 2 hours
    and then began to decline. When protein and glucose were combined, the peak response was
    similar to that of glucose alone. However, during the late postprandial period, the
    glucose response was reduced by 34%. The insulin responses for protein and glucose were
    similar, but when combined the insulin response was nearly doubled. The glucose decrease
    when protein and glucose were combined was attributed to the increased insulin response to
    the combination. See Figure 1. </font></p>

    glucose appearance rate over 8 hours following the ingestion of 50 g protein in the form
    of very lean beef compared to water in subjects with type 2 diabetes. After water alone,
    the plasma glucose concentration decreased from 6.7 mmol/l (120 mg/dl) to 5.4 mmol/l (98
    mg/dl). After 50 g of protein, the glucose concentration at 1 hour increased by 0.1 mmol/L
    (3 mg/dl) and then decreased similarly to water. The ingested protein resulted in only ~2
    g glucose being produced and released into the circulation. The fate of the remaining
    absorbed amino acids is unknown. Plasma insulin changed little after water, but after
    protein there was a threefold increase in insulin and a 50% increase in plasma glucagon. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">This raises the question of why, if gluconeogenesis from
    protein occurs, does the glucose produced not appear in the general circulation? Several
    theories have been suggested. The first is that considerably less than the theoretical
    amount of glucose (50&#150;60%) produced from protein actually is produced and enters the
    general circulation, and the small amount of glucose released is matched by a
    corresponding increase in glucose use, if adequate insulin is available.<sup>4</sup>
    Another theory suggests that the process of gluconeogenesis from protein occurs during a
    24-hour period, and the slowly and evenly produced glucose can be disposed of over a long
    period of time.<sup>5 </sup>It is also speculated that the insulin stimulated by dietary
    protein causes the glucose formed to be rapidly stored as glycogen in the liver and in
    skeletal muscles. This glucose can then be released when insulin levels are low or
    glucagon levels are elevated, and the body does not identify if the glucose is from
    protein or carbohydrate. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">To understand this process of gluconeogenesis and the
    question of why protein does not affect blood glucose levels, it is helpful to briefly
    review the metabolism of dietary proteins. The majority of protein is digested, and the
    amino acids not used for gut fuel are metabolized in the intestinal mucosal cells and
    transported by the portal vein to the liver for protein synthesis or gluconeogenesis.<sup>12</sup>
    In the liver, nonessential amino acids are largely deaminated, and the amino group
    (nitrogen) removed is converted into urea for excretion in the urine.<sup>13 </sup>It has
    been shown that in subjects without and with mild type 2 diabetes, ~50&#150;70% of a 50-g
    protein meal is accounted for over an 8-hour period by deamination in the liver and
    intestine and synthesis to urea.<sup>14</sup> It has been assumed that the remaining
    carbon skeletons from the nonessential amino acids are available for glucose synthesis,
    which would then enter into the general circulation. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">The essential amino acids pass through the liver into the
    general circulation, where they may be removed and used for new protein synthesis or,
    alternatively, for skeletal muscle fuel. Circulating amino acids stimulate insulin and
    glucagon secretion. The amino acids that stimulate glucagon are different from those that
    stimulate insulin secretion.<sup>15-17 </sup></font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">To add to the confusion, the effect of protein on glucose
    appearance is influenced by insulin availability. With insulin deficiency, the oxidation
    of branched chain amino acids in muscle and uptake of alanine (the principle glycogenic
    amino acid) by the liver is accelerated, resulting in increased gluconeogenesis and
    augmented protein catabolism.<sup>18</sup> The accompanying rise in glucose levels is most
    likely due to an increased conversion of ingested protein into glucose and to a decreased
    glucose removal rate. In subjects with diabetes who had insulin withheld for 24 hours,
    there was a three- to fourfold increase in liver glucose output after protein ingestion.<sup>19</sup>
    However, in the presence of insulin, alanine uptake by the liver is virtually zero,<sup>20</sup>
    and hepatic glucose production falls by 85%.<sup>21 </sup>Indirectly then, insulin could
    reduce gluconeogenesis in the liver by decreasing the amino acid substrate supply. Insulin
    also inhibits the degradation of body proteins and lowers the circulating concentration of
    many amino acids.<sup>22 </sup></font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">The net effect on glucose output by the liver depends on the
    ratio of insulin to glucagon. In people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, the glucagon
    response to protein is considerably greater than in people without diabetes.<sup>4</sup>
    Glucagon stimulates an increase in hepatic glucose production due to an increase in
    glycogenolysis and an increase in gluconeogenesis. Glucagon antagonizes the effect of
    insulin in the liver. However, it does not antagonize the insulin-stimulated uptake of
    glucose in muscle or the insulin-mediated decrease in release of non-esterified fatty
    acids from fat cells.<sup>4 </sup></font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Therefore, the process of gluconeogenesis is affected by
    substrate supply and level of glycemic control. However, in people with well-controlled
    diabetes, minimal amounts of hepatic glucose are released into the general circulation
    after the ingestion of protein. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3"><strong><em>Does protein slow the absorption of carbohydrate?
    <br>
    </em></strong>In the study by Nuttall et al.,<sup>10</sup> when protein and glucose were
    combined, the peak response was similar to the peak response of glucose alone. That is,
    adding protein to carbohydrate did not slow the absorption or peak of the glucose
    response. (Figure 1). </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Incidentally, what is a &quot;fast-acting&quot; carbohydrate?
    Previously, it was assumed that fast-acting carbohydrates were sugars or juices. It is now
    known that this is not true, and if there were a fast-acting carbohydrate, it would
    probably be a starch.<sup>23</sup> &quot;Fast-acting carbohydrate&quot; is a term we need
    to eliminate from our diabetes vocabulary. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">The effect of adding protein (25 g) or adding fat (5 or 10 g)
    to breakfasts containing 60 g carbohydrate in 24 subjects with type 2 diabetes was also
    studied by Nordt et al.<sup>24</sup> Glucose concentrations were similar after the three
    meals, but after the protein-enriched meal, the postprandial insulin and glucagon
    responses were significantly increased. Neither varying the ratio of fat to protein nor
    increasing the amount of fat affected postprandial glucose values. The late reduction in
    postprandial glucose observed by Nuttall et al.<sup>10</sup> with the addition of protein
    was not seen in this study. This may be due to the fact that in this study more normal
    amounts of protein were added. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">How adding large amounts of protein or fat to a standard
    lunch would affect postmeal glucose responses and insulin needs in subjects with type 1
    diabetes was studied by Peters and Davidson.<sup>25</sup> In 12 individuals who by the use
    of a biostator were euglycemic, a standard lunch (450 kcal) was compared to protein-added
    (200 kcal) or a fat-added (200 kcal) lunch. After the fat-added lunch (2 Tbsp margarine),
    the peak glucose response was delayed, but the total glucose response was unchanged. After
    the protein-added lunch (7 oz turkey), the early glucose response was similar to the
    standard lunch, but late glucose response (2&#150;5 hours) was slightly increased, and the
    late insulin requirement was greater by 3&#150;4 U. This late insulin requirement
    (2&#150;5 hours) was statistically significant, although the total insulin requirement
    over the 5 hours was not. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Adding protein did not delay the peak glucose response, but
    whether the addition of protein to a meal or snack prevents late-onset hypoglycemia cannot
    be answered by this study. The study ended at 5 hours, at which time glucose levels were
    similar after all three meals. (Figure 2.) </font></p>

    the main determinant of the peak glucose response.<sup>26,27 </sup>Although this may vary
    depending on the glycemic response to the carbohydrate, it appears not to be affected by
    the protein content. Fat delays the peak but not the total glucose response.<sup>25,28</sup>
    However, patients often report that when they eat large amounts of certain foods, such as
    pizza, meat, or fat, their blood glucose responses are elevated even if they keep their
    carbohydrate consistent.<sup>29,30</sup> The reason remains a mystery, but this does mean
    that if patients have documented this response to certain foods, they will probably need
    to adjust their premeal short- or rapid-acting insulin or eat smaller servings of these
    foods. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3"><em><strong>Is it important to have protein for a bedtime
    snack or before exercise? <br>
    </strong></em>First, we should consider the logic of recommending the addition of 1&#150;2
    oz. of protein to prevent hypoglycemia. Even if 50% of the protein were converted to
    glucose and entered into the circulation, this would only be a total of 3.5&#150;7 g of
    glucose. It is unlikely that this amount of glucose would have much effect on increasing
    blood glucose levels. The mechanism would have to be due to protein's effect on glucagon
    (or on other counterregulatory hormones). However, the effects of glucagon are reported to
    be short-lived and transient.<sup>31,32</sup> </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">The recommendation to add 1 or 2 oz of protein to an evening
    snack to prevent late-onset hypoglycemia was studied by Hess and Beebe.<sup>33</sup> In 15
    well-controlled subjects with type 1 diabetes, two bedtime snacks, 30 g carbohydrate or 30
    g carbohydrate plus 14 g protein, were consumed on three separate occasions, and blood
    glucose was compared at 1, 2, and 3 hours postprandial and at fasting. Blood glucose
    values before the bedtime snack (132 vs. 120 mg/dl) and 1 hour and 2 hours after the
    snacks were similar, but blood glucose values at 3 hours postprandial and at fasting were
    significantly higher after the protein-containing snack (144 vs. 164 mg/dl 3 hours
    postprandial, and 112 vs. 143 mg/dl fasting, respectively). </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">There were no significant differences in hypoglycemic
    incidents, so it is uncertain whether adding protein to a 30-g carbohydrate snack was
    necessary or whether it just added unneeded calories. However, if overnight hypoglycemia
    is a problem that cannot be corrected by insulin adjustments, rather than add extra
    carbohydrate to the bedtime snack, protein could be tried. Furthermore, if individuals
    were still hungry after the 30-g carbohydrate snack, adding extra protein might be better
    than adding extra carbohydrate. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">There is also no evidence to suggest that adding protein to a
    snack before (or after) exercise prevents hypoglycemia any better than just a carbohydrate
    snack. Nathan et al.<sup>34</sup> reported that in intensively treated individuals with
    type 1 diabetes, a 13-g carbohydrate snack before exercise of short duration (&lt;45 min)
    was enough to prevent post-exercise hypoglycemia. </font></p>

    hypoglycemia prevent late-onset hypoglycemia? <br>
    </em></strong>In a small study (six subjects with type 1 diabetes), Gray et al.<sup>35</sup>
    reported on the rate of restoration of euglycemia after treatment of hypoglycemia with
    either identical amounts of carbohydrate (15 g) or carbohydrate supplemented with protein
    (14 g) and the subsequent development of hypoglycemia. Subjects were given insulin by
    infusion until their glucose levels fell to 2.8 mmol/l (50 mg/dl) and were then treated.
    After both treatments, the insulin infusion was continued for the next 3 hours or until
    glucose again fell to 2.8 mmol/l. Glucose levels, time to peak glucose levels, and
    subsequent rate of glucose fall were similar after both treatments. Despite hypoglycemia,
    glucagon concentration did not increase in either group until food was ingested. At that
    point, there was a transient increase in glucagon in the group treated with carbohydrate
    plus protein with no effect on glucose levels (Figure 3.). The researchers concluded that
    adding protein to the treatment of hypoglycemia merely adds unneeded calories. </font></p>

    cause renal disease? <br>
    </strong></em>Despite the widespread belief that protein ingestion can influence the
    development of renal disease, dietary intake of protein is reported to be similar in
    patients with or without nephropathy. Nyberg et al.<sup>36</sup> investigated protein
    intake in three groups: 1) patients who had diabetes 30 years or more without nephropathy;
    2) patients with nephropathy but stable glomerular filtration rates; and 3) patients with
    progressive nephropathy and declining glomerular filtration rates. In all three groups,
    average protein intake was &gt;80 g/day (~16&#150;17% of daily calories), with no
    relationship between the amount of protein ingested and the progression of nephropathy. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Watts et al.<sup>37</sup> investigated dietary protein in
    patients with type 1 diabetes with and without microalbuminuria. Dietary protein intake
    was similar in both groups. Ekberg et al.<sup>38</sup> also found no support for a
    relationship between high protein intake and glomerular hyperfiltration in insulin-treated
    patients. In tobacco users with hyperfiltration, a positive relationship was found between
    urinary albumin excretion and protein intake, but this was not found in non-users of
    tobacco. Jameel et al.<sup>39</sup> reported on dietary protein intake and clinical
    proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes. Again, protein intake was simila, with no
    correlation between protein intake and clinical proteinuria. In all of the above studies,
    protein intake was in the range of usual dietary intake and rarely exceeded 20% of the
    calories. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">In a cross-sectional, clinic-based study (EURODIAB IDDM
    Complications Study) of more than 2,500 people with type 1 diabetes, individuals who
    reported protein consumption of &lt;20% of total calories had average albumin excretion
    rates (AERs) below 20 mg/min. However, in those in whom protein intake was &gt;20% (22% of
    patients), average AERs increased and were in the microalbuminuric range (&gt;20 mg/min).
    Of the patients with macroalbuminuria, 32% consumed &gt;20% of protein, while this
    percentage was 23% for the microalbuminuric and 20% for the normoalbuminuric individuals
    with type 1 diabetes. Trends reached statistical significance for total protein and animal
    protein, while no association was seen for vegetable protein. This trend was particularly
    pronounced in patients with hypertension and/or elevated HbA<sub>1c </sub>values. These
    findings support the recommendation for people with diabetes not to consume protein
    intakes &gt;20% of total calories.<sup>40 </sup></font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">In an interesting study, excess microalbuminuria was related
    to saturated fat intake and not to protein. In a cross-sectional, population-based study
    of Tasmanian adults with type 1 diabetes with microalbuminuria, on at least two or three
    occasions, excess microalbuminuria was associated with relative high intakes of saturated
    fat and a decreased prevalence with relative high intakes of protein.<sup>41</sup> </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3"><strong>High-Protein, Low-Carbohydrate Diets <br>
    </strong>Weight loss and improved blood glucose control are claims being made for
    high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets. The advantages of the high-protein, low-carbohydrate
    approach are that diets that eliminate a whole category of nutrients, in this case
    carbohydrates, are lower in calories and so result in weight loss. With a high protein
    intake and strict limitation of carbohydrate, water stored with glycogen (carbohydrate) is
    released. This rapid loss of fluid is an initial boon to dieters looking for fast results.
    Unfortunately, it isn't stored fat that is being lost. Fasting ketosis, which results in
    loss of appetite, may also develop. Furthermore, few people can eat endless amounts of
    animal protein and fat for weeks on end, and so they eat less and less. The good news is
    that, with a high-protein diet, weight is lost, insulin needs drop, and blood glucose and
    sometimes even lipid levels often improve. It works, at least temporarily. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Although the authors of the popular books all take a slightly
    different approach, the basic premises are fairly similar. Eating a high-carbohydrate diet
    makes people &quot;fat&quot; because carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels, causing
    a greater release of insulin, and higher insulin levels cause carbohydrate to be stored
    easily as fat. Eating a high-protein diet leads to weight loss, decreased insulin levels,
    and improved glycemia. However, neither this nor the claim to &quot;cure&quot; insulin
    resistance&#151;the oversecretion of insulin which they say causes carbohydrate to be
    stored as fat&#151;with a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet is supported by scientific
    evidence. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Nor is there good evidence that insulin resistance from
    eating a diet rich in starchy foods and sugar is the cause of obesity. In fact, it is
    obesity that causes insulin resistance, not the other way around. But regardless,
    increased physical activity, energy restriction and/or moderate weight loss, and
    controlling fat intake have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, not changes in the
    protein-to-carbohydrate ratio.<sup>42,43 </sup></font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">High-protein diets claim to offer other benefits. For
    example, protein stimulates the release of glucagon, a hormone that raises the level of
    blood glucose and counteracts the actions of insulin, and eating right means balancing
    insulin and glucagon levels. Therefore, the argument goes, if not enough protein is eaten,
    too much insulin is released and not enough glucagon. It is true that the balance of
    insulin and glucagon release is important in the metabolism and storage of nutrients. But
    it is doubtful that you can change the balance by eating more protein. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Another claim is that if the right kinds of fat are eaten,
    individuals will not become fat. However, there appears to be a hierarchy for the
    autoregulation of substrate utilization and storage that is determined by storage capacity
    and specific fuel needs of certain tissues.<sup>44</sup> For example, alcohol has the
    highest priority for oxidation because there is no body storage pool for it, and
    conversion of alcohol to fat is energetically expensive. Amino acids and carbohydrates are
    next in the oxidative hierarchy. Body proteins are functional, and there are not storage
    depots for amino acids. There is a limited capacity to store carbohydrate as glycogen, and
    conversion of carbohydrate to fat is energetically expensive as well. In contrast, there
    is virtually unlimited storage capacity for fat, largely in adipose tissue, and the
    storage efficiency of fat is high. Because of the oxidative priority of alcohol and
    protein, the body has an exceptional ability to maintain their balance across a wide range
    of intake of each. Carbohydrate oxidation closely matches carbohydrate intake.<sup>45,46</sup>
    Therefore, the amount of fat oxidized or stored is the difference between total energy
    needs and the oxidation of the other priority fuels&#151;alcohol, protein, and
    carbohydrate. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3"><em><strong>Protein, Satiety, and Weight Loss <br>
    </strong></em>The effects of dietary fat and carbohydrate on regulation of energy intake,
    weight loss, and satiety have been studied, but little research has been done related to
    protein. Short-term studies have suggested that protein exerts a more positive effect on
    satiety per calorie than both carbohydrate and fat.<sup>47-49</sup> However, this may not
    translate into eating fewer calories. Stubbs et al.,<sup>49</sup> in a 1-day study,
    reported that although subjective hunger was less after a high-protein breakfast compared
    to a high-fat or high-carbohydrate breakfast, lunch-time intake 5 hours later and energy
    intake for the rest of the day were similar after all three breakfasts. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Skov et al.<sup>50</sup> studied the effect on weight loss in
    obese subjects of replacement of carbohydrate by protein in <em>ad libitum</em>
    fat-reduced diets. Food was supplied to the 50 subjects for 6 months and could be consumed
    <em>ad libitum</em>. The diets were low in fat (30% of energy) with a group randomly
    assigned to either a high-protein (25% protein, 45% carbohydrate) or high-carbohydrate
    (12% protein, 58% carbohydrate) diet. At 6 months, the high-protein group had lost 8.9 kg
    (20 lb) with a fat loss of 7.6 kg (17 lb) compared to the high-carbohydrate group loss of
    5.1 kg (11 lb) and fat loss of 4.3 kg (9 lb). </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Over the course of the study, energy intake was lower in the
    high-protein group by ~8,000 calories (~42 kcal/day), which probably accounted for the
    difference in weight loss. The researchers attributed the decrease in calories to the
    higher satiating effect of protein compared to carbohydrate. The real test of
    effectiveness would be to follow the subjects for the next 2 years to identify food
    choices after the completion of the study and to determine if weight lost during the study
    was maintained. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Aside from the problem that no long-term research is
    available to document that high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets maintain weight loss any
    better than traditional weight-loss diets,<sup>51</sup> what are other concerns? A major
    concern is that foods with proven health benefit are eliminated. There are health needs
    for the nutrients found in grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, and other
    carbohydrate-containing foods. When analyzed, these diets are seriously short of essential
    nutrients, such as vitamins C and D, folic acid, and especially calcium. The excess
    protein also has the potential to cause the body to lose what little calcium is ingested. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">A typical day's menu for women from one of the popular diets
    reveals that it contains ~1,200 calories and less than half of the RDA for the B vitamins,
    iron, magnesium, zinc, and copper. The meal plan for men contains ~1,700 calories and less
    than half of the RDA for the B vitamins, magnesium, and copper.<sup>52 </sup>Taking a
    supplement to replace missing nutrients is not the complete solution either, because all
    of the essential nutrients found in foods have not yet been identified and so cannot be
    replaced. These diets are also low in fiber, which can contribute to constipation. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Should health professionals recommend a diet known to be
    nutritionally inadequate to people with diabetes in an effort to improve blood glucose
    control? This is an ethical question that deserves an answer. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">As noted earlier, foods rich in protein are often high in
    fat, especially saturated fats and cholesterol, and the long-term effects on lipids from
    these diets is unknown. A study of subjects following a high-protein, low-carbohydrate
    diet for 12 weeks reported substantial increases in plasma levels of both uric acid and
    low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, decreases in triglycerides, but no increase in
    high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, despite effective weight loss.<sup>53 </sup></font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">With only three macronutrients to
    manipulate&#151;carbohydrate, protein, and fat&#151;there are not many options left to
    sell a new diet book. We have gone through the high-carbohydrate approach, and it is
    unlikely that a high-fat approach will go far, so we are left with recycling the
    high-protein diet. However, moderation is generally the best approach: eating a healthful
    diet, being more physically active, and keeping food records along with blood glucose
    records so that blood glucose levels can be kept under optimal control. Although long-term
    research is needed, a better direction to study may be a moderate protein and
    carbohydrate, low-fat diet instead of the current popular high-protein, higher-fat,
    low-carbohydrate diets. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">The bottom line: people are obese not because they eat too
    many carbohydrates, but because they eat too many calories. Eating carbohydrates does not
    make people fat unless they overeat carbohydrates (just as when they overeat protein and
    fat). There is evidence that high levels of dietary fat are associated with high levels of
    obesity,<sup>54</sup> but there is no evidence that high intake of &quot;simple&quot;
    sugars or carbohydrates, unless they contribute to a high caloric intake, are associated
    with high levels of obesity. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">We are reminded that popularity is not credibility. There is
    little research published in peer-reviewed journals to support the low-carbohydrate,
    high-protein diets. High-protein diet books are based on personal experiences and
    testimonials and contain theories that usually would not survive peer review. Authors
    quote their own studies as proof. However, their studies have not shown this to be an
    approach that individuals can follow long-term. Long-term studies are necessary to
    determine how long individuals can comfortably consume a high-protein diet in the world
    outside of the research lab. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3"><em><strong>Focus on Blood Glucose Control, Not Weight Loss <br>
    </strong></em>Perhaps we need to ask why we have focused lifestyle changes for type 2
    diabetes on weight loss instead of on improving blood glucose control? Certainly, all of
    us would like to be able to help individuals lose and maintain weight loss, but research
    reveals little long-term success.<sup>50 </sup>Research is clarifying why weight loss is
    difficult<sup>55-57</sup> and documenting the psychological problems associated with the
    dieting process.<sup>58</sup> Obesity is associated with the development of chronic
    diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, and prevention of chronic diseases may require a better
    understanding of what controls appetite and better tools, including medications, to
    prevent weight gain or assist in weight loss. However, treatment for individuals who
    already have type 2 diabetes needs to focus on lifestyle strategies for the improvement of
    the associated metabolic abnormalities. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Early in the course of the disease when insulin resistance is
    present, energy restriction not related to weight loss and moderate weight loss (10% of
    body weight or 10&#150;20 lb) have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity.<sup>59-63</sup>
    But as the disease progresses and insulin deficiency becomes the central issue, it may be
    too late for weight loss to be helpful.<sup>64 </sup>Furthermore, mortality is not related
    to obesity (body mass index) in people with type 2 diabetes,<sup>65,66</sup> nor is
    obesity associated with the micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes.<sup>67,68</sup>
    Many of the long-term problems associated with type 2 diabetes are associated with
    glycemic control.<sup>69</sup> Preliminary research suggests that even if weight loss is
    maintained over 12 months in subjects with type 2 diabetes, initial HbA<sub>1c</sub>
    improvements are not maintained.<sup>70</sup> </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Therefore, the focus should be on controlling blood glucose
    (and lipid) levels, not on weight loss. Teaching people carbohydrate counting, encouraging
    physical activity, keeping food records, and monitoring blood glucose levels are
    essential.<sup>71,72</sup> The diet doesn't fail; the pancreas and treatment protocol
    fail. Furthermore, all glucose-lowering medications work more effectively when used in
    combination with medical nutrition therapy.</font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3"><strong>Protein Needs and Type 2 Diabetes <br>
    </strong>It had been assumed that, in people with type 2 diabetes, abnormalities of
    protein metabolism are less sensitive to insufficient insulin action than those of
    glucose. However, studies by Gougeon et al.<sup>73,74</sup> have demonstrated that
    moderate hyperglycemia can contribute to an increased turnover of protein in subjects with
    type 2 diabetes compared with an obese control group. The maintenance of body composition
    and nitrogen equilibrium are at the &quot;cost&quot; of more rapid turnover of protein and
    require sufficient energy and protein intakes. Insufficient protein intake does not
    support nitrogen equilibrium. To obtain positive nitrogen balance requires glycemic
    control, either via exogenous insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs), and a higher
    protein intake.<sup>74-76</sup> In contrast to subjects who did not have diabetes,
    euglycemia with a very-low-energy diet did not completely reestablish nitrogen equilibrium
    in people with type 2 diabetes.<sup>73,75</sup> Furthermore, when energy is restricted, a
    higher protein intake is required for maintaining lean body mass while selectively
    mobilizing fat.<sup>77</sup> </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">This suggests that people with type 2 diabetes have an
    altered adaptive mechanism for protein sparing, independent of protein quality.<sup>73,75 </sup>Previous
    studies have suggested that smaller amounts of circulating insulin are sufficient to
    prevent protein loss in type 2 diabetes.<sup>78,79</sup> It appears abnormalities of
    protein metabolism are present even with mild hyperglycemia. The threshold for abnormal
    nitrogen synthesis and breakdown is reported to be at a fasting glycemia between 6 and 7
    mmol/l (108&#150;125 mg/dl).<sup>80 </sup>Therefore, with moderate energy restriction
    there is need for a generous dietary protein intake (~1 g/kg body weight). However, this
    is not more than the amount of protein consumed on a usual basis by people with type 2
    diabetes. Treatment of type 2 diabetes that consists of OHAs or insulin, moderate energy
    restriction, and adequate protein intake not only improves glucose and lipids, but also is
    able to correct several aspects of whole-body protein metabolism. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3"><strong>Protein Needs and Type 1 Diabetes <br>
    </strong>Protein degradation and conversion of both endogenous and exogenous protein to
    glucose in type 1 diabetes depends on the state of insulinization and degree of glycemic
    control. In insulin-deficient individuals, both limited and excess dietary protein can
    have adverse effects. Conversion of excess dietary or endogenous protein to glucose may
    adversely influence glycemic regulation. On the other hand, these individuals might be
    more susceptible to body protein loss during dietary protein restriction. Definitive
    answers to these concerns are still unknown.<sup>81</sup> </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Insulin deficiency increases both whole-body protein
    synthesis and protein breakdown with oxidation of essential amino acids.<sup>82</sup>
    However, the synthesis and degradation might not involve the same proteins.
    Gluconeogenesis also is increased, and hepatic extraction of alanine, a key amino acid
    gluconeogenic precursor, is accelerated.<sup>19</sup> Excessive rates of hepatic glucose
    production, proteolysis, and amino acid oxidation in type 1 diabetes are all reduced by
    insulin administration,<sup>82</sup> but proteolysis and amino acid oxidation are more
    resistant to the suppressive effects of insulin.<sup>83</sup> Normalization of protein
    metabolic rates may, therefore, require long-term tight metabolic control.<sup>84</sup>
    Today, with improved glycemic management in type 1 diabetes, a more normal protein
    synthesis, breakdown, and oxidation should occur. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3"><strong>Summary <br>
    </strong>Let's review recommendations given to people with diabetes in regard to protein
    and try to determine if the research supports any or all of them. </font></p>
    </div><ul>
      <li><div><p><font size="3">&quot;Proteins are foods like meat, cheese, and peanut
        butter.&quot; Only partly true; in most cases these foods are protein-plus-fats. </font></p>
        </div></li>
      <li><div><p><font size="3">&quot;Between 50&#150;60% of protein becomes glucose and enters
        the bloodstream about 3&#150;4 hours after eaten.&quot; Perhaps 50&#150;60% of protein
        goes through the process of gluconeogenesis in the liver, but virtually none of this
        glucose enters into the general circulation. </font></p>
        </div></li>
      <li><div><p><font size="3">&quot;Don't eat fruit, fruit juice, or a sweet for a snack
        without also eating a source of protein to slow the absorption of carbohydrate.&quot; In
        none of the studies reviewed did added protein slow or change the peak postprandial
        glucose response. </font></p>
        </div></li>
      <li><div><p><font size="3">&quot;Bedtime snacks should always contain protein.&quot; No
        clear answer is available, but protein may not be needed. Even if protein is added, the
        effect on blood glucose levels is not great. However, people with diabetes (without renal
        disease) can be advised to eat an extra serving of protein rather than carbohydrate at
        meals or for snacks if they are still hungry after eating their usual carbohydrate
        servings. </font></p>
        </div></li>
      <li><div><p><font size="3">&quot;Treat an insulin reaction with a fast-acting carbohydrate,
        and add protein to provide a later source of blood glucose. This will prevent the blood
        glucose from dropping too low again.&quot; One small study concluded that adding protein
        to the treatment of hypoglycemia only added unwanted or unneeded calories. Would this also
        be true when protein is added to bedtime snacks? Furthermore, the term &quot;fast-acting
        carbohydrate&quot; should be eliminated. </font></p>
        </div></li>
      <li><div><p><font size="3">&quot;Eating too much protein can damage the kidneys.&quot; In
        people with diabetes, no evidence supports the claim that protein intakes &lt;20% of total
        daily caloric intake contribute to the development of renal disease. </font></p>
        </div></li>
    </ul>
    <div><p><font size="3">What about the high-protein, low carbohydrate diets? Initial
    results are often dramatic in terms of weight loss and impact on glycemia, but no
    long-term controlled clinical research has been done. We do not know if individuals follow
    these types of diets any better long-term than other low-calorie diets or whether weight
    loss would be maintained if they did. We also do not know the long-term effect of such
    diets on blood glucose levels and overall health. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Although protein ingestion increases circulating insulin in
    all people, in obese people with type 2 diabetes, the insulin secretion to protein is
    greater than in subjects without diabetes.<sup>10,85</sup> In people without diabetes,
    protein is a relatively weak stimulant of insulin compared to glucose,<sup>9</sup> while
    in people with type 2 diabetes who are still able to secrete considerable amounts of
    insulin, protein and carbohydrate are equal in stimulating insulin response, and when
    combined the insulin response is additive in people without diabetes but is synergistic in
    people with type 2 diabetes.<sup>9,10</sup> Stimulating endogenous insulin can be viewed
    as a positive or a negative&#151;negative because of the potential endogenous
    hyperinsulinemia and its association with insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease;
    positive because protein ingested with carbohydrate can have a synergistic effect on
    insulin, thus improving the postprandial response to carbohydrate. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Obtaining positive nitrogen balance in people with type 2
    diabetes requires glycemic control and adequate protein intake, especially when energy
    intake is restricted. Fortunately, the large amount of protein in the customary diet of
    people with diabetes compensates for the increased protein catabolism and thus protects
    from protein malnutrition.<sup>86</sup> </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">In people with type 1 diabetes, the effect of protein on
    glycemia will be dependent on the state of insulinization and the degree of glycemic
    control. Protein requires insulin for metabolism, as do carbohydrate and fat, but has
    minimal effects on blood glucose levels. In well-controlled diabetes, large amounts of
    protein have the potential to contribute to glucose production, minimally increase blood
    glucose levels, and require additional small amounts of insulin. If protein is decreased,
    insulin doses may also need to be decreased. There is limited evidence to suggest that
    protein contributes to a sustained elevation of blood glucose levels, slows absorption of
    carbohydrate, or is helpful for the treatment of hypoglycemia. </font></p>
    </div><div><p><font size="3">Finally, the focus should shift from debating the ideal
    percentages of calories from macronutrients and instead should focus on the goals of
    diabetes medical nutrition therapy and strategies known to assist in achieving these
    goals. Nutrition recommendations must be individualized based on treatment goals and an
    assessment of what the individual is currently eating, what changes might be beneficial,
    and the changes the individual is willing and able to make. People with diabetes need
    accurate information on which to base their decisions, because ultimately they make the
    final decision as to what they will eat. </font></p>
