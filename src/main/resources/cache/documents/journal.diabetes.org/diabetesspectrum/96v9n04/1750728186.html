        <p><font size="4" face="New York"><strong>Abstract </strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">In November 1995, the first
        nationwide campaign to increase awareness that
        diabetes-related amputations can be prevented was
        announced, the result of a collaboration among 10 public
        and private partners. The campaign, &#147;Feet Can Last a
        Lifetime,&#148; was organized by staff at the National
        Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
        (NIDDK). It featured patient workshops on foot care,
        health-care provider workshops on detecting insensate
        feet, a mass media public information campaign, and
        dissemination of foot-care information kits to people
        with diabetes and to health-care professionals. The
        campaign&#146;s audiences included people with diabetes
        and their families; health-care providers; partner
        organizations and their affiliates; the news media; and
        the general public. A well-recognized health
        communications model guided development, implementation,
        and evaluation of the campaign. Campaign methodology was
        based on this six-stage model and incorporated strategies
        for reaching each target audience. The methodology
        included creating a theme, inviting interested
        organizations to participate, developing
        audience-specific communication materials, implementing a
        mass media campaign, and conducting community-level
        educational workshops. Results were measured in several
        ways and revealed some weaknesses. Overall, however, the
        campaign succeeded in increasing awareness that diabetic
        foot amputations can be prevented. While this campaign
        was launched nationally, it can serve as a model for
        regional and local efforts. Health-care providers can
        refer to this model in developing their own
        amputation-prevention workshops and generating media
        coverage.</font></p>
        <hr>
        <p><font face="New York"><strong>The Problem</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">&#147;An ounce of prevention is
        worth a pound of cure,&#148; is certainly an appropriate
        maxim when discussing foot care for people with diabetes.
        Consider these statistics.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">&#149; An estimated 54,000
        diabetes-related lower extremity amputations (LEAs) are
        performed annually,<sup>1</sup> with hospital and
        surgical costs totaling $500 million per year.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">&#149; The 5-year survival rate
        for these patients is ~ 50%.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">&#149; Between 50% and 75% of
        these amputations can be prevented.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">Despite these compelling
        figures, Kenny and colleagues5 found that ~ 53% of family
        physicians reported adherence to recommendations for
        semiannual foot examinations for patients with type II
        diabetes. Adherence was ~ 64% for family practitioners
        treating patients with type I diabetes.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York"><strong>Campaign Goal and
        Objectives<br>
        </strong>To increase awareness that diabetes-related LEAs
        can be prevented, 10 federal, voluntary, and professional
        organizations (Table 1) joined forces in November 1995
        for National Diabetes Month, to launch the &#147;Feet Can
        Last a Lifetime&#148; public health campaign.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">The campaign&#146;s goal was to
        increase awareness among health-care providers, people
        with diabetes and their families, and the general public
        that LEAs can be prevented with daily foot care, use of
        appropriate footwear, and regular examinations by
        health-care providers. The campaign&#146;s objectives
        were:</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">&#149; to hold local workshops
        to educate and instruct patients and providers on
        diabetic foot care and detection of problems,</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">&#149; to use the mass media to
        increase public, patient, and provider awareness that
        LEAs can be prevented, and </font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">&#149; to develop and distribute
        education- al materials about amputation prevention to
        health-care providers and people with diabetes.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York"><strong>Communications Approach<br>
        </strong>The communications approach incorporated
        principles of social marketing, health education, and
        mass communication, and was based on a well-recognized
        health communications model that identifies six stages of
        activity.<sup>6</sup> These stages were used to guide the
        development and dissemination of communication materials
        for each of the target audiences.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">When developing public health
        programs, health-care professionals may want to refer to
        these stages or consider an alternate communications
        model.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">1. Planning and Strategy
        Selection: identifying the problem, the target audience,
        and the goals and objec tives of the campaign, and
        developing the message and evaluation component.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">2. Selecting Channels and
        Materials: identifying existing materials that can be
        used in the program, channels most appropriate for
        reaching target audiences, and types of materials best
        suited for the message and audiences.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">3. Developing Materials and
        Pretesting: developing different approaches for
        communicating the message and testing it with the tar get
        audiences.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">4. Implementation: introducing
        the campaign to the target audiences.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">5. Assessing Effectiveness:
        analyzing results of measurements developed in stage 1
        and determining whether the target audiences are
        receiving the message, whether the channels of
        communication are appropriate, and whether the campaign
        needs to be adjusted.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">6. Feedback to Refine Program:
        using evaluation results to improve the program.</font></p>

        </center></div><p><font face="New York">In the Planning
        and Strategy stage, campaign developers recognized that
        several partner organizations already had programs and
        materials in place to promote foot care. Although the
        &#147;Feet Can Last a Lifetime&#148; campaign was new, it
        also supported and expanded ongoing activities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">The organizers also recognized
        that several equally worthy diabetes messages were
        competing for attention in November (National Diabetes
        Month), including the National Eye Institute&#146;s
        annual diabetic eye disease awareness campaign and the
        release of new statistics on the prevalence of type II
        diabetes at a news conference sponsored by the American
        Medical Association, the American Diabetes Association
        (ADA), and NIDDK.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">The partners, aware that they
        needed an interesting media angle, decided to focus
        attention on the Department of Veterans Affairs, which
        was seeking to increase visibility of its amputation
        prevention program. Focusing on the VA gave the partners
        an opportunity to present amputation prevention from a
        unique perspective. First, veterans receiving their
        health care though VA hospitals have a high incidence of
        diabetes-related amputations, some 9,000 each year.
        Second, Veterans Day is in November, creating a natural
        tie-in for the news media.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York"><strong>Campaign Methodology</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">The &#147;Feet Can Last a
        Lifetime&#148; campaign was designed and implemented in
        five steps over a 4-month period. Providers may want to
        consider these five steps when developing local foot-care
        activities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">1. Create a campaign identity.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">2. Identify coalition partners.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">3. Develop targeted
        communication materials.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">4. Develop and implement a mass
        media campaign.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">5. Support/conduct local foot
        care workshops and outreach activities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York"><em>Creating a campaign identity</em>.
        The planning group discussed the importance of developing
        an attractive and attention-getting slogan that presented
        the issue of amputation in a non-threatening manner. The
        group decided on &#147;Feet Can Last a Lifetime: If you
        have diabetes, take steps for healthy feet&#148; because
        it is nonjudgmental and encourages people to take care of
        their feet. The graphic design accompanying the slogan
        showed four pairs of feet, representing different age
        groups and ethnicities. Since diabetes disproportionately
        affects minorities, it was important that the design
        reflect cultural diversity. The slogan and logo are not
        copyrighted, and educators are encouraged to use the
        campaign identity when developing local programs. If
        educators prefer to develop their own logo, they should
        consider contacting a local graphic artist or working
        with the art department at their institution.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York"><em>Identifying coalition
        partners</em>. The cornerstone of the campaign was the
        participation and coordinated activities of coalition
        partners. Having multiple organizations endorse a message
        not only enhances believability and campaign credibility,
        but also increases the number of communication channels
        available for dissemination.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">The partnership&#146;s success
        was due to the mutually beneficial nature of this
        relationship. While 10 public and private agencies
        participated in the campaign&#146;s premiere, other
        organizations could have been involved. Materials and
        messages already developed by partner organizations were
        featured in the information kits, enabling partners to
        reach a broader audience while supporting the
        campaign&#146;s goals and objectives.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">To participate as a partner,
        organizations had to meet three criteria.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">1. Demonstrate an interest or
        involvement in amputation prevention.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">2. Serve populations at risk for
        LEAs.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">3. Have a network of hospitals,
        clinics, or chapters willing to promote the campaign
        locally.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">Most of the 10 partners have
        local affiliates and programs, and educators may want to
        consider contacting their local ADA, JDF, CDC, and VA
        hospital to discuss forming a foot-care partnership.
        Other potential partners could include churches,
        community groups, podiatrists, and pedorthic specialists.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">Developing targeted
        communication materials. Four information kits were
        developed to support the campaign. Each was designed for
        a specific audience: patients/consumers, health-care
        providers, partner organizations (technical assistance
        kit), and the news media (media kit). These kits are all
        still available. Ordering information is listed at the
        end of this article.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">The patient/consumer kit
        provides practical information on foot care and includes
        a foot-care fact sheet, a reprint of the CDC&#146;s
        &#147;Taking Charge of Your Diabetes: Prevent Foot
        Problems,&#148; a JDF <em>Countdown</em> magazine article
        called &#147;Fit Feet,&#148; and new Medicare guidelines
        for therapeutic shoe reimbursement prepared by the
        Pedorthic Footwear Association. The kit also contains a
        home-care item: a towel bar/doorknob hanger with
        foot-care tips that can be placed in a bathroom or
        bedroom, where people are likely to examine their feet.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">The materials for health-care
        providers were designed for two purposes: to provide
        materials that could be duplicated and distributed to
        patients, and to educate providers on screening for nerve
        damage using the technique endorsed by the Lower
        Extremity Amputation Prevention (LEAP) program. </font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">The kit features the LEAP
        screening instructions and a monofilament (a device to
        identify loss of protective sensation), a patient video
        on foot care and footwear selection, and a foot screening
        training video for health-care professionals. The kit
        also includes a reprint of a July/August 1995 <em>Diabetes
        Spectrum</em> From Research to Practice section on
        preventing lower extremity amputations, and patient
        education materials. A full-color poster with foot-care
        tips, a promotional button, and doorknob hangers also are
        included. Health-care providers can purchase the kit for
        $15 (for shipping and handling). A foot-care slide set
        for health-care professionals, developed by the Indian
        Health Service and National Diabetes Information
        Clearinghouse, is also available for $15. Educators are
        encouraged to use these materials in developing and
        conducting local programs.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">The technical assistance kit was
        developed to aid partner organizations in planning and
        conducting local workshops and generating media coverage.
        Three months before the campaign launch, NIDDK staff
        conducted a needs assessment among partners to gauge the
        types of assistance needed. The technical assistance kit
        includes fact sheets and articles appropriate for
        distribution to patients; a guide to working with the
        news media; print and radio public service announcements;
        a news media kit including sample press releases; and the
        campaign poster, doorknob hangers, and promotional
        buttons. Many of the partner organizations specifically
        requested promotional materials during the needs
        assessment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">Diabetes educators may want to
        use the technical assistance kit for guidance in planning
        and publicizing patient workshops. These materials are
        not copyrighted, and educators may reproduce as many
        copies as they need. </font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">It is well documented that a
        comprehensive mass media strategy can be one of the best
        ways to reach large, diverse audiences. However, messages
        are usually more believable when heard from a trusted
        source, such as a local physician, nurse, or other
        health-care provider. While partner hospitals and clinics
        developed workshops to educate patients and health-care
        providers on amputation prevention, other partner
        organizations used materials in the technical assistance
        kit to strengthen and supplement existing programs. Media
        coverage drew attention to these efforts and increased
        public awareness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">Implementing a mass media
        campaign. A comprehensive mass media campaign was
        considered an effective means for reaching providers and
        people with diabetes with the foot-care message. The
        strategy was to generate national news coverage for the
        campaign and local coverage for community-based efforts.
        The media kit was distributed to 1,500 media outlets,
        including national newspapers, selected local newspapers,
        minority media, syndicated columnists, and wire services.
        A video news release (VNR) was produced and promoted to
        the 850 television and cable stations around the country.
        Staff placed follow-up telephone calls to media to
        increase coverage.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">Diabetes educators may want to
        use the media materials, including sample press releases,
        found in the &#147;Feet Can Last a Lifetime&#148;
        technical assistance kit, to facilitate local media
        coverage. A guide for working with the media and print
        and broadcast public service announcements are included
        in the kit. Educators associated with hospitals and
        clinics should consider working with the public relations
        staff at their institutions to a develop a media list and
        to place media calls.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York"><strong>Campaign Evaluation</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">The evaluation component of the
        campaign was developed during the planning phase and
        implemented following the launch. Measures of the
        campaign&#146;s success included:</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">&#149; numbers of
        patients/providers reached through local educational
        workshops and free community screenings,</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">&#149; numbers of the general
        public potentially reached through national and local
        media, and</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">&#149; numbers of
        providers/consumers requesting educational materials
        through the toll-free telephone num- ber.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">In developing the evaluation
        component of their own programs, diabetes educators
        should consider what can be measured. For example, if a
        foot-care workshop is held, educators could develop and
        distribute an evaluation form to assess the effectiveness
        of materials and the workshop. If media coverage is a
        component of the program, educators may want to track how
        many people received their message by monitoring media
        placements and gathering audience demographics. Educators
        may want to consult with the public relations staff at
        their institution for information on media monitoring.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York"><em>Media evaluation.</em> Media
        coverage was tracked by newspaper and television
        monitoring services. Broadcast monitoring reports showed
        that the three television networks, ABC, CBS, NBC, and
        the Cable News Network used the VNR, which was
        distributed via satellite on November 3, 1995. Local
        television stations also used the VNR and interviewed
        local spokespeople, including physicians at VA hospitals.
        Approximately 40 million people received the foot-care
        message through local and national television coverage.
        Several local radio stations interviewed partner
        spokespeople for a total listenership of 3 million. Print
        readership totaled 10 million. In all, approximately 53
        million people potentially received the foot care
        message. </font></p>

                example, a group of 10-15 is more personal and
                gives you the opportunity to provide one-on-one
                instruction. A community screening of several
                hundred people allows you to identify people at
                risk for diabetic foot problems.</font><p><font face="New York">2. Select a date and time for the
                workshop, and reserve appropriate space. If
                patients are older and not work ing full-time,
                they may prefer an early-morning work shop,
                whereas working adults may prefer an evening or
                Saturday clinic. If you plan to include guest
                speakers or health-care professionals to take
                medical histories and conduct pedal exams, check
                their schedules before selecting a date.</font></p>
                <p><font face="New York">3. Design an
                invitation/flyer that is eye-catching and easy to
                read. Open with an attention-getting headline,
                and then list the who, what, when, where, and how
                information. Include graphics if they enhance the
                message. Include a reply card or a phone number
                so peo ple can respond.</font></p>
                <p><font face="New York">4. Mail
                invitations/flyers 3 weeks in advance. Follow up
                with a reminder card or phone call 10 days before
                the event.</font></p>
                <p><font face="New York">5. Develop an agenda
                that encourages patient interaction and
                participation. Build in time for questions and
                answers and individual counseling. Make sure you
                have brochures, fact sheets, and other literature
                on foot care to distribute. You may want to use
                materials developed by the &#147;Feet Can Last a
                Lifetime&#148; campaign.</font></p>
                </td>
                <td valign="top" bgcolor="#CAECDD"><font face="New York">6. Develop a theme and make sure
                it is dominant in workshop materials, including
                any marketing materials, such as doorknob
                hangers, magnets, shoe horns, mirrors, and
                posters. If funds allow, develop a giveaway item
                that displays the theme.</font><p><font face="New York">7. Display posters or flyers to
                promote the workshop. Encourage local media to
                publicize the event. When talking to the media,
                emphasize the prevalence of dia- betes and number
                of annual amputations in your area. If a
                prominent person in the community is
                participating in the workshop, mention him or her
                by name.</font></p>
                <p><font face="New York">8 . Make sure speakers
                and health-care providers understand the needs of
                the participants. For example, if you are
                conducting a workshop with older African-
                American men, ask African-American health-care
                providers to participate.</font></p>
                <p><font face="New York">9. Fill the workshop
                with practical &#147;how-to&#148; information.
                Eliminate technical terms where possible.
                Speakers who recite too many facts and figures
                may lose the audience.</font></p>
                <p><font face="New York">10. Develop an
                evaluation form. Ask participants what they
                thought about the session, what they learned, if
                they would recommend the workshop to others, and
                how they think it can be improved. Ask whether
                the time and location were convenient.</font></p>

        Distribution Evaluation.</em> Counting the calls made to
        a toll-free phone number managed by the National Diabetes
        Information Clearinghouse was another component of
        evaluation. To date, the clearinghouse has distributed
        about 4,000 health-care provider kits and 100,000
        consumer kits. Both provider and consumer kits included
        response cards to assess reaction to the materials; 500
        health-care providers and 700 consumers responded.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">According to providers who
        responded, the most useful items were the monofilament,
        the patient and provider videos, the doorknob hanger, and
        the poster. Seventy-five percent of responding providers
        indicated that they had shared all of the materials,
        including the printed information, with their patients.
        Several professionals noted that the kit design could be
        improved so that materials did not spill out. Twenty-four
        percent indicated that they needed additional quantities
        of door knob hangers.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">Consumers indicated that they
        had read the materials. Forty-five percent noted that the
        Medicare information on therapeutic shoes was helpful.
        Seventy-eight percent indicated that they would like to
        see a mirror added to the kit, for assistance in
        examining their feet. And 35% requested additional
        information on topics such as nerve disease, diet, and
        exercise.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York"><strong>Evaluation Conclusions</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">The &#147;Feet Can Last a
        Lifetime&#148; campaign was effective in increasing foot-
        care awareness among modest numbers of people with
        diabetes and health-care providers. Evaluation of the
        campaign and input from the 10 partner organizations
        revealed that the effort could be improved in the
        following ways.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">&#149; The campaign was
        conceived in June 1995, and implemented in November of
        the same year. Four months&#146; lead time was not
        adequate for all partner organizations to have programs
        in place. In the future, it would be preferable to have a
        9- month lead time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">&#149; National Diabetes Month
        has become saturated with media and consumer messages. A
        spring cam paign emphasizing fitness activities and
        athletic shoe selection may be more effective.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">&#149; The amputation prevention
        message alone was not compelling enough to capture the
        media&#146;s attention. Several reporters commented that
        54,000 amputations was not a high enough number to
        interest their readers/viewers. In contrast, when HRSA
        announced that a $10 monofilament could save $1.4 mil
        lion per year in amputation-related expenses, the media
        responded. In the future, the monofilament&#146;s role in
        amputation prevention should be emphasized.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">&#149; The National Diabetes
        Outreach Program (NDOP) of the NIDDK reproduced 4,000
        health-care provider kits at a cost of $15 each and
        100,000 patient/consumer kits at a cost of $1 each. The
        supply of both kits was depleted within 6 months of the
        launch. Due to the cost of reproducing the kits, the
        campaign is in need of a corporate or volunteer agency
        sponsor. </font></p>
        <p><font face="New York"><strong>How to Participate in <br>
        &#147;Feet Can Last a Lifetime&#148;</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">The &#147;Feet Can Last a
        Lifetime&#148; campaign is ongoing and is seeking new
        partners to help spread the foot-care message to diabetes
        patients and health-care providers. Sponsors willing to
        reproduce and distribute the health-care provider kits
        also are needed. Organizations interested in reproducing
        large quantities of the health-care provider kits can
        purchase the art work on computer disk for $500 (includes
        duplication of disk, shipping and handling). Master
        copies of the other three kits (consumer/patient, media,
        and technical assistance) are available at no charge.
        These materials are not copyrighted, and individuals are
        encouraged to reproduce quantities as needed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="New York">For more information about
        participating in the program or to request master copies
        of the free kits or the provider kit on disk, please
        write to Lorraine Marchand at the correspondence address
        listed on the first page of this article. Although the
        campaign had to be temporarily discontinued in June 1996,
        limited quantities of the patient/consumer and
        health-care provider kits are now available. Please call
