        </strong>Nearly everyone with diabetes can derive some benefit from an exercise program,
        although not all benefits will be realized by each person with diabetes. Autonomic
        neuropathy may affect several systems that are necessary for the body&#146;s adjustment to
        exercise, and careful screening is extremely important. The risks and benefits of exercise
        must be carefully considered in those with chronic complications of diabetes, as should
        the deleterious effects of not participating in any physical activity.</td>

    <p>Nearly everyone with diabetes can derive some benefit from an exercise program,
    although not all benefits will be realized by each person with diabetes. Both health care
    professionals and patients with diabetes need to remember this when determining the
    components of an exercise program. When chronic complications of diabetes develop, the
    benefits and risks of exercise must be carefully considered to maximize the benefits and
    assure safety.</font><sup>16</sup><font FACE="New York,Times New Roman"> This is
    especially true when evaluating the use of exercise in diabetes complicated by autonomic
    neuropathy.</p>
    <p>In considering the benefits and risks of exercise for those with chronic complications
    of diabetes, attention must also be given to the effects of not participating in some
    level of physical activity. Known as disuse syndrome, the deleterious effects of an
    imbalance between rest and physical activity include decreased physical work capacity,
    muscle atrophy, negative nitrogen and protein balance, cardiovascular deconditioning,
    pulmonary restrictions, and depression.</font><sup>17</sup><font
    FACE="New York,Times New Roman"> The consequences of disuse combined with the
    complications of diabetes are likely to lead to more disability than the diabetes
    complications alone. Since physical activity can prevent or reverse disuse syndrome,
    serious consideration must be given to the use of exercise in all people with diabetes,
    including those with autonomic neuropathy.</p>

    </center></div><p>Diabetic autonomic neuropathy can strike any system of the body (e.g.,
    cardiovascular, respiratory, neuroendocrine, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, sudomotor,
    or ocular), since the autonomic nervous system regulates all involuntary functions in the
    body. Many of these systems are integral to the ability to perform exercise. The possible
    risks from autonomic neuropathy on the body&#146;s response to exercise and resulting
    safety considerations are discussed below. Table 1 provides a summary of the effects of
    autonomic neuropathy on exercise risk.<sup>18</sup></p>
    <p><strong>EFFECTS OF AUTONOMIC&nbsp; NEUROPATHY ON EXERCISE RESPONSE Cardiovascular
    Autonomic Neuropathy<br>
    </strong><em>Heart rate. </em>The impact of autonomic neuropathy on the cardiovascular
    system is of utmost importance to exercise capacity and safety, since cardiovascular
    autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is manifested by abnormal heart rate, blood pressure, and
    redistribution of blood flow. The cardiovascular anomalies of autonomic neuropathy involve
    both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.<sup>19</sup> Resting heart-rate
    is primarily controlled by the parasympathetic system, whereas maximal heart-rate and
    blood pressure responses to standing, sustained hand grip, and other types of exercise are
    mainly functions of sympathetic activity (which controls blood vessel tone).</p>
    <p>It is generally considered that parasympathetic dysfunction precedes sympathetic loss.
    However, more sensitive tests have revealed that there may be pervasive but uneven areas
    of sympathetic denervation of the heart, which otherwise appears normal, and these
    findings indicate significant risk for premature death.<sup>20,21</sup></p>
    <p>Patients with CAN have higher resting heart rates and lower maximal heart rates during
    exercise than diabetic patients without autonomic neuropathy.<sup>22</sup> The lower
    maximal heart rate achieved during exercise makes the use of heart rate to gauge exercise
    intensity inappropriate for many of these patients.</p>
    <p>Unexplained sudden death not associated with myocardial infarction, in which the heart
    becomes unresponsive to nerve impulses (cardiac denervation syndrome), has been reported
    in diabetic patients with CAN.<sup>23,24</sup> A variety of potential mechanisms have been
    proposed to explain sudden death, but an exact understanding of this occurrence remains
    speculative.</p>
    <p>Prolonged QT intervals corrected for heart rate (QTc) have been found in diabetic
    patients with autonomic neuropathy.<sup>24,25</sup> A prolonged QTc is an indicator of
    increased risk for sudden death. Lengthening of QT/QTc intervals over time is associated
    with deterioration of autonomic function.</p>
    <p>Some investigators have suggested that the electrocardiographic evaluation of QT/QTc
    interval should be conducted to evaluate autonomic neuropathy in that this evaluation may
    provide some information about the risk of sudden death.<sup>18</sup> It should be noted,
    however, that inter-observer variability with regard to the measurement of QT interval and
    QT dispersion is high.<sup>26</sup> Thus, although this noninvasive method for identifying
    patients who may be at an increased risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias is
    promising, one should be aware of difficulties with regard to QT measurements. </p>
    <p><em>Ventricular function.</em> Abnormal left ventricular responses to exercise have
    been observed in patients with CAN.<sup>27,28</sup> Zola and associates found depressed
    left ventricular systolic function in the absence of ischemic heart disease in
    approximately one-third of patients with autonomic neuropathy.<sup>22,29</sup> Reduced
    mean ejection fractions at rest and with maximal exercise have also been reported.<sup>30</sup>
    Abnormal diastolic function has been found in patients with more severe CAN.<sup>31</sup>
    This finding was correlated with a reduction in catecholamine levels and postural
    hypotension, indicating sympathetic involvement with cardiac diastolic dysfunction.<sup>31</sup>
    These potential ventricular function abnormalities indicate the importance of prescribing
    exercise at low to moderate intensities in this patient population.</p>
    <p><em>Blood pressure.</em> Blood pressure response with posture change and during
    exercise is abnormal in those with CAN. Postural hypotension, often defined as a drop in
    systolic blood pressure of &gt;20&#150;30 mmHg or a drop in diastolic blood pressure of
    &gt;10 mmHg upon standing, may be seen. </p>
    <p>Postural hypotension is caused by the failure of reflex vasoconstriction in the
    splanchnic area and the subcutaneous tissues, and its extent is related to the severity of
    baroreflex dysfunction.<sup>32</sup> As a result of this vasoconstrictive dysfunction, the
    blood pressure response to exercise does not increase to expected levels in these
    patients. A lower mean systolic blood pressure response at comparable relative exercise
    workloads in patients with autonomic neuropathy compared to diabetic subjects without this
    complication has been reported.<sup>19,22</sup> Zola and Vinik, however, also found that
    subjects occasionally have severely exaggerated increases in blood pressure.<sup>3</sup></p>
    <p>The symptoms of postural hypotension may occur with eating or within a few minutes of
    taking insulin. The effect of insulin may be the result of direct action on the peripheral
    blood vessels, causing vasodilation.<sup>34</sup> The insulin-induced hypotension is often
    worse in the morning and improves later in the day.<sup>18</sup> This must be taken into
    consideration when determining the timing of exercise in relation to meals and insulin
    injections. Exercise may need to be deferred to later in the day, and insulin should not
    be injected just before exercise, regardless of the location of the injection.</p>
    <p>Postural hypotension symptoms are similar to those of hypoglycemia and may be mistaken
    for a drop in blood glucose, even though they are due to a drop in blood pressure.
    Patients should be alerted to the potential confusion in these symptoms and instructed to
    check blood glucose before treating for hypoglycemia.</p>
    <p><strong>Ventilatory Reflexes<br>
    </strong>Patients with autonomic neuropathy may have impaired ventilatory reflexes.
    However, it is not clear if this is the direct result of autonomic dysfunction.</p>
    <p>Sobotka and associates reported that five of eight patients with diabetic autonomic
    neuropathy lost their ventilatory drive and ventilatory response to hypoxemic conditions
    at rest.<sup>35</sup> They concluded that the respiratory dysfunction in these patients
    resulted from the failure of initiation of respiratory drive under conditions of hypoxia
    and that the defect was either in the carotid body or in the parasympathetic afferents. No
    significant difference in the ventilatory response to transient hypoxia with exercise
    between diabetic subjects with and without autonomic neuropathy was found by Calverly and
    associates.<sup>36</sup></p>
    <p>During exercise, additional input from other sources, such as catecholamines or local
    chemical changes in muscles, may compensate.<sup>37</sup> Tantucci and associates found
    that diabetic subjects with autonomic neuropathy had an excessively increased respiratory
    rate and alveolar ventilation with stressful exercise (&gt;90% maximum predicted heart
    rate or symptom-limited).<sup>38</sup> A progressively higher inspiratory activity was
    proposed to be involved with the greater ventilatory response to exercise. The suggested
    mechanism was reduced neural inhibitory modulation from sympathetic afferents and/or
    increased CO2 chemosensitivity. This finding emphasizes the need to be cautious about
    exercise intensity.</p>
    <p><strong>Abnormal Neuroendocrine Response<br>
    </strong>In the normal response to exercise, catecholamines rise due to activation of the
    sympathetic nervous system. The increase in catecholamines is directly related to the
    intensity of the exercise. This catecholamine response causes blood glucose levels to
    increase through hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, as well as through lipolysis.
    In addition, glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone are increased by adrenergic
    stimulation, adding to the increase in blood glucose.</p>
    <p>A blunted response of catecholamines and other glucoregulatory hormones to exercise has
    been reported in those with autonomic neuropathy, but with no effect on blood glucose
    values.<sup>39</sup> The specific importance of this abnormal neuroendocrine response on
    exercise or post-exercise metabolism is unclear, but it may be a contributing factor to
    exercise intolerance.</p>
    <p><strong>Gastroparesis<br>
    </strong>Gastroparesis may be present in some patients with autonomic neuropathy. The
    effect of gastroparesis on exercise capacity is related to timing of the arrival of
    nutrients to the bloodstream. It is important that patients be aware of their specific
    presentation of gastroparesis and timing of nutrient delivery. Use of medications and
    techniques to assist with normalizing gastric emptying should be attempted if not
    contraindicated.<sup>40</sup></p>
    <p>Liquids are preferred over solids to prevent or treat hypoglycemia in patients with
    gastroparesis, since the rate of liquid emptying remains within the normal range for most
    of these patients.<sup>40</sup> Individuals using diabetes medications that can cause
    hypoglycemia should keep liquids containing carbohydrate available during and after
    exercise.</p>
    <p><strong>Hypoglycemia Unawareness<br>
    </strong>The loss of early warning signs of hypoglycemia (hypoglycemia unawareness) can
    occur in diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy. Normally, as blood glucose begins to
    fall, there is an asymptomatic slowing of the heart rate and mild hypotension produced by
    a parasympathetic response. This is followed by sympathetic release of norepinephrine that
    does produce symptoms of hypoglycemia, which are usually easily recognized.<sup>31</sup>
    With diabetic autonomic neuropathy, the ability to recognize these symptoms may be reduced
    or absent.</p>
    <p>It is vital for patients with hypoglycemia unawareness to frequently check their blood
    glucose to prevent episodes of unconsciousness. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose is
    especially important when participating in physical activity, since reductions in blood
    glucose can occur up to several hours after the conclusion of exercise.</p>
    <p><strong>Sweating and Cutaneous Blood Flow Disturbances<br>
    </strong>Reduced or absent sweating in the lower body and hyperhydrosis of the upper half
    of the body may be present in autonomic neuropathy. The loss of sweating in the lower body
    can cause dry, brittle skin on the feet, which can contribute to ulcer formation. In
    addition, microvascular skin blood flow may be impaired in patients with autonomic
    neuropathy. This causes a poor response to vasoconstrictors (such as cold) and
    vasodilators (such as heat).<sup>41</sup> Vinik identifies dryness of the skin with
    cracking fissures and cold toes with bounding pulses as sufficient indication of reduced
    small-vessel reactivity.<sup>18</sup> </p>
    <p>Both sweating disturbances and compromised cutaneous blood flow in the lower limbs
    underscore the need to provide appropriate foot care information to these patients before
    they begin an exercise program. Patients must use properly fitting shoes and routinely
    examine their feet before and after exercise. It is also extremely important that patients
    stay adequately hydrated and do not exercise in extreme temperatures.</p>
    <p><strong>NECESSARY TESTING<br>
    Autonomic Function<br>
    </strong>The clinical features of autonomic neuropathy are often easily missed since they
    can be mild and nonspecific.<sup>42</sup> Subclinical abnormalities may be present at
    diagnosis, even in teenagers.<sup>43-46</sup> This emphasizes the importance of careful
    screening and appropriate testing for the presence of autonomic neuropathy before
    embarking on an exercise program.</p>
    <p>Tests that evaluate the cardiovascular reflexes are most often used because of their
    noninvasive nature and the importance of identifying the potentially serious
    cardiovascular problems resulting from autonomic neuropathy. The reader is referred to
    pages 224 and 227 for discussions of autonomic testing. </p>
    <p><strong>Exercise Capacity and Evaluation for the Presence of Coronary Artery Disease<br>
    </strong>In addition to evaluating the patient for the presence and severity of autonomic
    neuropathy, testing should be conducted to determine exercise capacity and whether
    coronary artery disease (CAD) is present. Exercise testing protocols for populations at
    risk for CAD are recommended for those who meet any of the following criteria: type 1
    diabetes and &gt;35 years of age, type 2 diabetes and &gt;35 years of age, type 1 diabetes
    for &gt;15 years, presence of any microvascular or neurological diabetes complications,
    presence of one or more additional coronary risk factors, or presence of suspected or
    known CAD.<sup>47,48</sup></p>
    <p>The exercise test should begin at an intensity significantly below the expected peak or
    symptom-limited capacity. The test should gradually increase in 2- or 3-minute stages with
    a suggested duration of 10 � 2 minutes.<sup>49</sup> Indications for terminating the test
    should be carefully observed. Test results should be the basis for determining duration
    and intensity of the exercise program.</p>
    <p>CAD is a major concern in patients with diabetes, and it is important that those with
    autonomic neuropathy also be screened carefully for this. Symptoms of angina are not
    reliable indicators of CAD in those with autonomic neuropathy, since these patients have a
    higher frequency of silent myocardial ischemia and infarction. Exercise thallium
    scintigraphy is the preferred screening for CAD in those with diabetic autonomic
    neuropathy.<sup>29,50</sup></p>
    <p>The need to carefully assess patients should not serve as a deterrent for recommending
    safe exercise for those with autonomic neuropathy, particularly if a patient expresses an
    interest in physical activity.</p>
    <p><strong>EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION<br>
    </strong>To maximize the benefits of physical activity, it is imperative that exercise
    prescriptions be tailored to each person&#146;s individual set of circumstances (e.g.,
    extent of complication involvement, medications, interest level, and desired outcomes of
    the exercise program). Exercise prescriptions must be developed jointly by the health care
    team and the person with diabetes.<sup>16</sup> The desired outcomes of an exercise
    program must be carefully considered, remembering that not all benefits of exercise
    (especially the cardiovascular-related ones) will be realized by each patient. The
    increased sense of well-being and positive outlook that can result from regular physical
    activity are extremely important benefits for this population.</p>
    <p>Exercise recommendations for those with complications of diabetes are based primarily
    on test results from acute bouts of exercise and on clinical judgement, with primary
    attention given to safety&#151;not on the results of specific training studies in these
    diabetic populations. Therefore, exercise guidelines are considered approximate, and
    modifications must be made for each patient. A conservative approach to exercise is
    recommended for those with autonomic neuropathy.</p>
    <p>The exercise prescription must address recommendations on intensity, type, duration,
    frequency, and rate of progression of physical activity based on the findings of careful
    evaluation. In addition, patients must be given information on safety precautions and
    symptoms to be aware of if discernible ones do develop. It may be most appropriate for
    those with CAN to participate in exercise programs supervised by people trained in cardiac
    care who have an adequate understanding of diabetes.<sup>18</sup></p>

    </center></div><p><strong>Intensity<br>
    </strong>It is frequently recommended that heart rate be used to determine the intensity
    of exercise. In patients with CAN, heart rate is not an appropriate indicator of
    intensity, since maximal heart rate is depressed.</p>
    <p>Instead, careful attention should be given to a patient&#146;s subjective feelings of
    intensity using the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale (Table 2). The exercise
    intensity is prescribed according to the numerical values associated with corresponding
    adjectives subjectively describing intensity. Vinik recommends that patients strive to
    reach a moderate-range RPE (~3) gradually over 2&#150;4 weeks.18 It is important that
    health care professionals clearly explain the RPE scale and emphasize its reliance on
    patients&#146; subjective feelings. Exercise should be terminated if a patient is unable
    to continue talking or, if pedaling, to maintain a consistent pedaling frequency.<sup>51</sup></p>
    <p><strong>Type<br>
    </strong>A patient&#146;s interest level should be what primarily drives the type of
    activity selected. It is important, however, that the person with diabetes and the health
    care professional give careful consideration to the Ease of Access and Ease of Performance
    Indices when selecting the most appropriate types of activities (see below).</p>
    <p>Activities that should be encouraged in this population are stationary cycling,
    semi-recumbent cycling, and water exercises.<sup>51</sup> Water activities and
    semi-recumbent cycling are especially beneficial for those with orthostatic hypotension,
    since the pressure of water surrounding the body and the semi-recumbent posture,
    respectively, help maintain blood pressure. Sitting in a chair doing light resistance
    exercises (e.g., lifting light weights or using an elastic exercise band) may help
    maintain or increase muscle strength.</p>
    <p>Activities that should be avoided are those that cause rapid changes in body position
    (e.g., certain calisthenics) or that cause rapid and significant changes in heart rate and
    blood pressure (e.g., high-intensity running or lifting heavy weights).</p>
    <p><strong>Duration<br>
    </strong>Patients with clinically significant autonomic neuropathy have reduced exercise
    tolerance resulting, in large part, from reduced cardiac output and faulty redistribution
    of blood flow to the working muscles. Consequently, the duration of exercise in these
    patients must be determined by patient tolerance. The starting duration should be based on
    the results of the exercise screening that was conducted before initiation of the exercise
    program and may be just a few minutes. The intensity of the exercise should not be
    increased to compensate for shortened exercise sessions.<sup>18</sup></p>
    <p><strong>Frequency<br>
    </strong>The U.S. Surgeon General now recommends for all people that physical activity be
    performed on most, if not all, days of the week to obtain health-related benefits.<sup>52</sup>
    For those with diabetes complications, this recommendation has added significance.</p>
    <p>The intensity and duration of physical activity may be modest in many of these
    patients. If even a small amount of physical activity can be done each day, it will allow
    patients to derive some of the benefits of physical activity more safely. It is more
    likely the activity will become a habit if participation occurs on a daily basis. In
    addition, daily activity will lessen the difficulty of balancing insulin dosages and food
    intake with physical activity in those taking insulin. Daily physical activity should be
    attempted, but it is important to remind patients that when days are missed, they should
    begin again as soon as possible and not feel defeated.</p>
    <p><strong>Rate of Progression<br>
    </strong>Progression of exercise in those with autonomic neuropathy must be done
    cautiously. Emphasis should be placed on increasing the frequency (if exercise is not yet
    being done daily) and duration of activity before increasing the intensity. The duration
    of physical activity should be gradually increased to accommodate the patient&#146;s
    functional capacity and clinical status. Any increase in intensity should be small and
    approached cautiously to minimize the risk of any dangerous cardiovascular events,
    musculoskeletal injuries, and/or relapse. Since those with CAN have a higher incidence of
    abnormal ventricular response to exercise, it is especially important to advance the
    exercise program slowly and with more careful monitoring.<sup>18</sup></p>
    <p><strong>PREVENTION OF HYPERGLYCEMIA AND HYPOGLYCEMIA<br>
    </strong>The importance of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) cannot be
    overemphasized for those with autonomic neuropathy, since the metabolic response to
    exercise is highly variable in these patients. In patients with type 1 diabetes, when the
    blood glucose is greater than ~240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) and adequate insulin will not soon
    be available, there is decreased muscle uptake of glucose and ongoing hepatic
    glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Under these circumstances, blood glucose may become
    severely elevated, and it is best to postpone exercise until metabolic control is
    regained.</p>
    <p>A mismatch between insulin levels and blood glucose may be especially common in
    patients with gastroparesis. Exercise should be planned around gastric delivery of
    nutrients in order to try to maximize the acute glucose-lowering effects of exercise.</p>
    <p>Because of the risk of hypoglycemia unawareness in patients with autonomic neuropathy,
    patients must receive careful instruction about the frequency and timing of SMBG, insulin
    action (peak and duration), and the importance of trying to avoid exercise at the peak of
    insulin action or before the stomach has delivered its contents (if gastroparesis is also
    present). Patients should be instructed on how to treat hypoglycemia, and significant
    others should be trained in the use of glucagon. A set time for participating in physical
    activity may be helpful in reducing the adjustments that need to be made to avoid hypo-
    and hyperglycemia.</p>
    <p><strong>MAINTENANCE OF THE EXERCISE PROGRAM <br>
    </strong>In addition to developing a safe exercise prescription and considering exercise
    precautions for those with autonomic neuropathy, attention must be given to factors that
    will assist patients in maintaining a regular physical activity program. Marrero and
    Sizemore have developed the Ease of Access Index and Ease of Performance Index to help
    patients determine how realistic their activity selections are.<sup>53</sup></p>
    <p>The Ease of Access Index asks the question, &quot;How easily can I engage in my
    activity of choice where I live?&quot; Many times, people select activities that they
    initially feel they can accomplish, but when examined in more depth, they find that they
    may have ignored, rationalized, or just not been aware of factors that may serve as
    barriers to long-term adherence to an exercise plan. To determine the ease of access for a
    given activity, patients should be asked to consider the following questions:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1. Does it require special facilities, and are these facilities available?</p>
      <p>2. Does it require special equipment, and is this equipment available and affordable?</p>
      <p>3. Does it require special training or instruction, and is this instruction readily
      available, scheduled at convenient times, easy to get to, and affordable?</p>
      <p>4. Does it require others to do it, and will these people be available at the
      appropriate times? </p>
      <p>5. Is it seasonal, and what will be done at other times of the year?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If the selected exercise activity is reasonably accessible, then an assessment of the
    ease of performance should be conducted. The Ease of Performance Index assesses of how
    suitable the activity is in terms of personal physical attributes and lifestyle. Patients
    should be asked to consider the following questions:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1. Does the activity suit your physical attributes?</p>
      <p>2. Can you realistically integrate the chosen activity into your current lifestyle?</p>
      <p>3. Can you afford any costs associated with it?</p>
      <p>4. Do you have a good support network if you need one for the activity?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The use of these two indices will hopefully help patients and health care professionals
    to consider in advance issues that often undermine long-term participation in physical
    activity.</p>
    <p>Other factors that may assist patients in maintaining a physical activity program
    include the following:<sup>54</sup></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1. Taking measures to avoid injury. A warm-up and cool-down consisting of low-intensity
      activity and static stretches should be done to reduce the likelihood of injury.</p>
      <p>2. Setting well-defined exercise goals. The goals should be precisely defined by
      exercise behavior (e.g., walk for 10 minutes daily at a 2 RPE rating) rather than by a
      hoped-for outcome (e.g., reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> by 1%).</p>
      <p>3. Setting an exercise schedule in advance. Having a schedule can help both in terms of
      forming a habit of physical activity and in making adjustments to the diabetes management
      plan easier.</p>
      <p>4. Involving an exercise partner. An exercise partner can help with motivation and
      encouragement, as well as provide safety for a patient with chronic complications. As
      mentioned above, a monitored exercise program may be best for patients with CAN.</p>
      <p>5. Identifying alternative activities. To reduce boredom, it may be helpful to assist
      patients in considering more than one type of activity. All possible activities should be
      evaluated for safety, as well as ease of access and ease of performance, as described
      above.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>SUMMARY<br>
    </strong>Physical activity should be carefully considered for all patients with diabetes.
    When the chronic complications of diabetes develop, it is especially important to weigh
    the risks and benefits of an exercise program in formulating the exercise prescription.
    The deleterious effects of not participating in any physical activity must also be
    factored in when making decisions about the use of exercise in those with chronic
    complications.</p>
    <p>Autonomic neuropathy may affect several systems that are necessary for the body&#146;s
    adjustment to exercise, particularly the cardiovascular system. Careful testing to
    evaluate autonomic function and to determine exercise capacity and the presence of CAD are
    extremely important. The need for careful evaluation before starting an exercise program
    should not prevent participation in physical activity. Working with patients to develop an
    appropriate exercise plan will yield a program with the greatest capability of maximizing
    the benefits.</p>
