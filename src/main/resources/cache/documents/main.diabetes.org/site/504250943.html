Hi,
 Don't know where to submit this, so please 
route to appropriate desk.
After reading today's news, I find that Kevin 
Covais (a 16 year old from Levittown, NY) 
finally lost on American Idol and that he is a 
diabetic. Checking on the net, I find that this 
is an amazing, talented, articulate and 
genuinely nice young man, a perfect person to be 
a Youth Advocate.
ADA could certainly use his voice (musically and 
otherwise) among our youth as well as adults 
because he was one of the most popular 
youngsters on the show and would be a great role 
model according to some teachers. Would be great 
at large conferences and in Diabetes Forecast.
Never met Kevin, but it appears that what you 
see is what you get. 
Don't know whether he is one of Kristen 
Driscoll's LI minions.
Best regards,
Steve Ucko

In reading about the pharmacist in Chadron Neb who was fired for taking his lunch break- I think that PUBLICALLY WalMart should be responsbile to explain why a person taking insulin should not be allowed a lunch break. For a professional person to be filling medications, providing an example to customers at Wal Mart- What kind of message does this send to others with diabetes? Eating consistent meals is not important? Bonnie Bath RN CDE

Can I access testimony that was given?; 
Can your office provide me with Stats pertaining

meter and supplies per year VS average rise in 
A1C of a person who does not have education 
provided.  
How much will they save by paying for education, 
meter and supplies vs. how much will they lose 
in cost of complications.

I am looking for Health Care Policy Guidance on 
how we can get this passed.

Regarding the DCRA in Ohio. I am an RN, CDE and 
cannot believe this has not passed yet.  That is 
my emotional statement.

I would like to suggest that the sample letter 
you have available, has to contain evidence based 
information. This bill will NOT go through unless 
we can provide financial statistics to the 
insurance industry, the Chambers of Commerece and 
the National Federation of Independent Business. 
NFIB, showing why they should support this Bill.

We must submit evidence that education decreases 
the A1C, which in turn decreases the cost of 
complications, reduces loss of productivity to 
the employer. There must be a proven cost benefit 
ratio before this will go through.  

Do you have a compiled list of research studies 
showing the effectiveness of DSME and use of BG 
monitoring? Please send it to me.

Do you have data on how costs have decreased in 
the other 46 states?  Please send it to me.


This information needs to be in all information 
we, as healthcare professionals, send to the 
legislators. They are not aware of the 
information.  They are as uneducated about 
diabetes as any person on the street.

Have we asked large groups such as the Teachers 
Union, AMA/ Ohio Medical Board, the AHRQ, Ohio 
Nurses Association to come and testify?

I am encouraged by your upcoming symposium for 
attorneys on discrimination for diabetic people 
in the workplace and school.

Another place where diabetic people are VASTLY 
discriminated against is in getting insurance.  
Rates are astronomical, and sometimes policies 
simply are not available for people who have 
diabetes...REGARDLESS of their control.  With A1c 
tests available, that should be a marker for 
decreasing insurance premiums, based on the 
length of time a person has had an A1c of 7% or 
less.  There are data to back the decreased 
illnesses in such a population.  Please include 
insurance in your discussions w/ attorneys.  
Thanks!

I have a specific question about medicare 
advantage insurance coverage. I have been on an 
insulin pump for more than 5 years, but only 
became eligible for medicare coverage as of 
1/1/06. I know that insulin when used in a pump 
was covered under Part B in the past, but now I 
am told it was switched to Part D. Can you verify 
that insulin no longer is covered under Part B, 
and if so, can something be done to appeal or 
change this coverage back.  I know that in my 
case It will push me into the donut hole of Part 
D coverage , and will literally cost me thousands 
of dollars. I have to believe that this is a 
common problem. Is there anyone I can write to or 
petition to have it covered under B.

Thank You for your attention to this matter.

Dual Eligible individuals, who are disabled due 
to mental difficulties, and are also diabetic. 
were assigned by the State of PA to Keystone 65 
Complete.  When they go to the drug company for 
their medications, they must now pay $1.00 or 
$3.00 for their medication.  However, to get 
Microlet Lancets to enable them to get a drop of 
blood for glucose readings they have to pay 
$10.09 for pack of 100.  The HMO, when asked 
states you must go to a Medical Supply firm, and 
not your drug store.  These individuals live on 
the Social Security &amp; SSI monthly payment of 
$650.40. and find it difficult to pay minimum 
amounts for their prescriptions.  Paying $10 for 
the Lancets is likely to have them take 1 or less 
readings a day to save money. or none at all.  
They all don&quot;t have a parent willing to take them 
to a Medical Supply firm.  The Drug stores have 
the Lancets, but do not get reimbursed fully, 
when sold to HMO covered individual.  This needs 
to be addressed.  Many of these individuals need 
5 or more prescriptions per month, and can&quot;t 
manage to pay their bills and eat properly.

I was suprised to see that on your survey asking

a space for the seemingly most obvious category 
of them all - a diabetic. As a Type I diabetic

would consider my strongest relationship to be

I have been a diabetic for 33 years, I would love 
to hear more about the advocacy alerts and 
possibly trying to become  more involved.  I have 
always been skeptical about becoming active in 
groups of any knid of nature, therefore I would 
like to ease into possibly  becoming  an active 
advocate for this dreaded disease.  I have 
written my local gov't officials before regarding 
diabetes.  In writing this e-mail and addressing 
my interest in our cause can I be rest assured 
that by submitting my personal information, in 
which case the ADA has on file already ( I am a 
current ADA member, and have been) that my 
personal info. will not be sold to any company 
for any reason.    Looking forward to hearing

Not all ADA Diabetes Advocates and ADA members 
disagree with President Bush's decision to veto 
HR 810 and we're not all liberals who 
passionately hate President Bush.  You seem to 
have forgotten these facts in sending out your 
barrage of e-mails containing inappropriate 
political commentary and emotionally charged 
rhetoric, e.g., &quot;It is sad to know that 
President Bush took that hope away from all of 
us&quot; and &quot;[T]he President's decision to veto H.R. 
810 is a devastating setback for Americans who 
are affected by diabetes . . .&quot;).  Some 
questions are clear-cut and the ADA's answers 
would be universally supported by ADA members 
and Diabetes Advocates.  Other questions are not 
so clear-cut, particularly this issue with deep 
religious, moral, and ethical implications.  I 
want a cure as much as the next person, but do 
not believe that the ends always justify the 
means.  I am appalled by the ADA's e-mails that 
blatantly, constantly, and offensively tell me 
how wrong my and the President's personal 
beliefs are.

My son and I met with Representative Walberg's office in Washington D.C. June 19, 2007 as delegates  for JDRF's Children's Congress.  We have had MANY problems for the past four years in his school and I wish to pursue state legislation protecting children within Michigan.  Specifically, I wish to have a law enacted that outlines what must be provided for each child with diabetes within the school system - whether it be a nurse or a trained person by a certified diabetes educator or someone overseen by a nurse.  

However, I do need some help in pursuing this and I know the ADA has successfully helped others do this for 10 other states, with different provisions outlined.  We attended Children's Congress with Hunter Sego, from Indiana who assisted in getting Legislation passed in Indiana (http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/05-09-2007/0004584695&amp;EDATE=)  My son and I are very active on a governmental level and are very serious in doing this, so I really hope someone will contact me to help me pursue this.  With all the difficultly my son and I have gone through it is time to put an end to it.  When others in my area heard that I was going head-to-head with the school system that begged me to help them.  That tells me it cannot be just within my household.  

My cell phone number is 517-896-8600.  I hope to hear from someone at your earliest convenience.  
Many thanks,
Nicolle Reslock

Currently in NYS there is a prohibition in NYS from anybody with Diabetes Mellitus obtaining a Commercial Driver's License.  This hearkens back to the dark ages, which dosages of insulin were not as exact and there was little accuracy in blood sugars.  Additionally, many people now wear the pump which has alarms, etc.  How can we change this to eliminate this discrimination?

ADA CEO'S
I'm writing to you as a active volunteer for the 
ADA for the  past 18years and as a parent of a 
child with diabetes for 18 years  his life 
depends on insulin  on a daily basis. I have 
raised thousands of dollars for this cause over 
the past years. I am hoping that ADA steps up to 
the plate to offer the enormous resources they 
have available. With the high incidence of 
diabetes along the Gulf Coast. Diabetics are  
dying because of the lack of insulin, 
medication, meters etc. As a volunteer I 
strongly recommend that the ADA comes forward to 
assist these suffering people.

I saw the article about how an annual flu shot is
beneficial to diabetics, and I wanted to comment.
I would LOVE to get an annual flu shot, but I run
into the same brick wall every year.
Before I was diagnosed, I told that there weren't
enough shots to go around, and they were saving
them for the elderly and those &quot;at risk.&quot;
Apparently, those of us who go to work every day
and pay for the stuff aren't a valuable enough
asset to society to warrant protection. But, why
should flu shots be any different?
Anyway, now that I'm officially a diabetic (Type
II), I'm told I'm &quot;at risk,&quot; but there are never
enough shots to go around, and now they tell me
I'm not old enough. I'll be 50 in September. 
Is it like this all over, or just in Ohio?
How old or sickly does one have to be to rate a
flu shot? Every year I hear about the dangers of
contracting whatever flu is active, and every year
I hear that diabetics are in particular danger if
they get it. And every year it's the same thing -
not old enough, not sick enough.
Do I really need to worry about getting a shot, or
should I put this off till I'm around 60?
Thanks,
Jim Eritano

doing because I am a diabetic and have been for 
the past eleven years.  The subject is 
especially hitting home for me now because I am 
just now six weeks pregnant with my first child 
and I am scared out of my mind of the 
complications I am possibly going to have, not 
to mention what the risks are to my child.  How 
can I get this message across to Bush that he 
needs to do something?  It no longer is just 
affecting me, its affecting another helpless 
life that has no right to bear the burdens this 
disease brings.  Please let me know everything I 
can do to bring this issue the attention it 
deserves.  

Thankyou,

I have been in contact with my Senator's Specter 
and Santorum (PA) about HR 810.  Senator 
Santorum did not support this bill and is 
supporting S 2754.  Senator Santorum &quot;snail 
mailed&quot; this all in a letter to me that I am 
more than happy to fax or snail mail to you.  
What is the ADA's position on S 2754?  It seems 
to be a watered down version.

FYI, I had a difficult time finding how to 
contact &quot;Diabetes Advocates&quot; via the site.  I 
thought this letter from Senator Santorum 
important to bring to your attention.  A 
telephone number would be good to list as well.

Some nurses also  have diabetes. This is ignored 
in your survey following the action letter re 
schoolchildren and the ANA proposal.
And even more important-not all RNs or LVN/LPTs 
are well grounded in care of diabetics- adult 
and children. They would also benefit from back-
up consulting while in the field

Just got this answer back this morning from my 
representative.  Thought you should see it.

Dear Ms. Clark,

Thank you for taking the time to write.

Medicaid services were about a tenth of the 
budget when I was first
elected.  They are about one third of the budget 
now. In the next ten
years, some have estimated they will balloon to 
the point of exceeding
the entire amount of the projected budget.

If we do not find a solution, at some point 
people will suffer because
there simply will not be funding to pay for 
services. I am not
interested in cutting services to people, except 
to fraudulent
claimants.  I am interested in tying to operate 
the system more
efficiently and less expensively.  

I applaud Governor Bush for taking on such a 
task and not saying, &quot;I'm
out of here in a year; you can worry about the 
problem down the road.&quot; ~
when it will be too late!

The plan, as thus far proposed, has generated a 
lot of general
objections, but no specific ones.  If you find 
that any actual
provisions of the proposed changes will 
negatively affect your diabetes
treatment, please contact me IMMEDIATELY and I 
will do whatever is
necessary to address the issue.

Thank you again for taking the time to write.

Sincerely,

Bill Posey

I am a single parent who has a diabetic son age 13. I am also a school teacher. Last year I missed approximately 30 days due to his up and downs, pump issues, sick issues etc. This year my son experience d his first diabetic seizure on Dec. 22nd, 07. Yesterday he wasnt feeling well and I felt compelled  to go to work because last year I was somewhat disciplined for missing so many days. Leaving my son alone at home was very hard for me to do. I brought the issue up to the superintendant and didnt get a positive response. My question is there any government program that protects my job? I feel pressure because I do miss a lot of work. My wife died in a car accident in 2002 and it is just myself taking care of my son.I  dont have family members close by to help. I am running out of sick days as well.

My son has a 504 plan at his public high school.  
I would like the school to allow me to bring  
containers of basic supplies (water and juice 
bottles and food) for my son to place in each of 
his classrooms.  Although both my son and the 
school nurse have supplies, my concern relates to 
emergency situations like a lockdown where 
children could be locked in a room for extended 
periods of time (2 - 6 hours).  The Principal has 
indicated that I may bring these items in but she 
cannot assure me that they will be safeguarded 
(locked up). 

I think that my request is a reasonable 
accomodation for my son (and for the ten other 
children at this school who have diabetes).  I am 
also concerned of the repercussions of the 
school's position in terms of younger children in 
other schools in our school district who have 
diabetes.  

I am scheduling a meeting to amend our son's 504 
plan to address this situation.  Your thoughts on 
the matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

My daughter and I are currently advocates.  We 
attended the 2003 C2C when my daughter was only 3 
years old.  She is currently 5 1/2 and has 
testified at a number of Senate hearings, been 
featured in an ADA training video, had lots of 
media coverage due to local stem cell issues, 
etc.  I would like to submit an application for 
her to be the next NYA...she is extraordinarily 
well-versed as any number of people can attest 
to.  Would this be possible; or does she really 
have to be 9 years or older?  She has had 
diabetes for over 4 years, (diagnosed at 15-
months, she gave her own shots at 2 1/2 years, 
and has had an insulin pump since 4 yrs.).  
Please let me know ASAP so that I may submit the 
appropriate materials (including one of your own 
videos) and get the testimonials from her CDE's, 
her Doctors, her friends that were ADA Mgmt. in 
LA, etc.

I recently had a complaint from a mother of a son 
with Type I diabetes that her insurance company 
will not cover the type of insulin (Novolog) that 
he has used for years without problems.  They 
want him to switch to a brand that is on their 
drug list.  Have they not thought about the risks 
of changing medications and the possiblities of 
higher costs due to problems with the new 
medication or even possiblilty of 
hospitalization.  Diabetes is such a complicated 
disease, why can't the insurance companies be 
compliant with what works for the diabetic 
individuals?

There are about 21 million diabetics in the US per your statements. I am one of them. This is a terrible desease. It is very important to each of us afflicted with it. I would be interested in contributing to support research, in preference to getting the government controlling it, if the ADA would try to get individuals afflicted to contribute. It doesn't seem it would take a great contribution if we are concerned enough to forvce the government to do it for us. Why can ADA not pursue this approach?

I don't know if I am sending this to the correct place, but anyway. My sister is a type 1 diabetic, as am I, she never seems to be able to get her test strips covered and she only knows how much insulin to take if she knows what her blood sugar is. I have told her to have her doctor get involved with this and make it a medical necessity, but she hasn't. I don't know how to have her find out if the insurance company is just doing this or if they are doing something incorrect. Whenever my mom and I bring the subject up she gets mad and yells at us that she can't get them to pay for the strips and while she is really mad at the insurance company she takes it out on us. I would like to get her some help in this matter, she and her husband make very little money and I know if I had to purchase my strips, I would find it very expensive. I have a fairly high co-pay but paying $50 is nothing compared to paying full price. If you can give me some info on what she could try or who she should contact to get some answers, I would greatly appreciate it.

Student says teacher pulled insulin pump 
mistaken for cell phone 
an Associated Press report 10/05/05 

CLERMONT - A substitute teacher pulled out a 
student's insulin pump after mistaking it for a 
cell phone, officials said. 

Cliffton Hassam told East Ridge High School 
officials that his insulin pump began beeping in 
class Friday. 

Before he could turn it off, substitute teacher 
Richard Maline ripped it from his leg, according 
to the written statement Hassam gave school 
officials on Tuesday. 

Hassam, a junior, is diabetic and wears the 
insulin pump to regulate his blood sugar level. 

Maline pulled the pump because he thought the 
beeping came from a cell phone, said Russell 
Anderson, executive director of human resources 
for Lake County School District. 

&quot;It fell to the floor,&quot; Hassam wrote in his 
statement to school officials. &quot;The second time 
he pulled it the tube came out of my leg.&quot; 

Maline realized his mistake after he grabbed the 
pump, Anderson said. 

In his statement, Hassam said his blood sugar 
levels did not return to normal until after the 
weekend. 

Maline has been removed from the school 
district's substitute teacher pool, Anderson 
said. 

Eva Hassam, Cliffton's mother, said she filed a 
complaint with the Lake County Sheriff's Office, 
and hopes to file charges against Maline and the 
school.

I just wanted to comment on the obstacles that Steve Chabot's office has put in place to ward off a high number of emails, which may end up being a deterrent for some people. I understand that our representatives probably receive a very large number of emails each day, but to makes us jump through hoops to merely send an advocacy message seems a bit rude, to say the least. I sent Mr. Chabot a message re diabetes and the ADA, but it wouldn't go through until I copied the message and sent it through his website. Okay, that's fine, but when you get there, we then have to find our extra 4 digits for our zip code, which means a few more steps. Once that is finished, we then have to go back to his website and enter all of our information again, (name, address, etc). I realize we're on a new website and need to give the info again, but it's even more steps to go through to send one message about diabetes. Maybe many of the other representatives are also doing this due to the high volume of emails they are receiving, but considering that they may very well end up with the same number of emails--if we all remain determined to get our message through and not worry about a lot of extra steps--it is obvious that they are merely trying to curtail the number of emails they are receiving. I don't think this is the answer to their &quot;email problem&quot; and will let his office know. I just wanted you to also know that the measures the representaives are taking may indeed stop some people from sending important messages. I'm sure you already know the extra steps needed to send the message because it is your site that lets us know that our message won't go through without going to the representative's site, but I just thought I'd give you one person's opinion on our representatives' tactics.

Without pump supplies, I'm in a great deal of trouble, and I do not have the money to pay cash (especially since I pay so much for health insurance).

My 7th grade (DX 2/24/030 rides the bus to and

Here goes.  This is in response to the strong 
opposition you posted on the AHP legislation 
that has been proposed.  ALthough I would like 
to see diabetes converage remain the same, I 
also have concerns for small business.  Keep in 
mind that small business often means less than 
10 or 20 employees, and they are being hit 
financially by so much legislation that they are 
unable to offer their employees health coverage 
at all.  I would rather see them able to offer 
some coverage for employees that will at least 
offer emergent care than be forced out of 
business by legislation that is just too 
expensive for them to continue.  Diabetics must 
accept their situation and seek employment with 
companies who are big enough to offer them 
coverage for their disease.  My eight year old 
daughter has had Type 1 diabetes since she was 
four, and I am trying to teach her to take care 
of herself and not to rely on those around her 
to be responsible for her disease.  I think this 
must also be encouraged in the adult population 
as the government does not owe us anything.  
ALso, we choose to pay more for our health 
coverage, out of our pocket, so that we can best 
provide for our children and ourselves.  The 
basic coverage is fine, but we want the best and 
thus sacrifice for it.  Where is that attitude 
in our society?  The rest of America doesn't owe 
me anything, and I will take care of myself, 
thank you.  Do we want some health care, or only 
what is best for the diabetic community?

I have a situation and would like an opinion on 
how to handle it. I have been a type 1 diabetic 
for about 3 years. I do not have it properly 
controlled for various reasons but am doing my 
best to get it that way. I take multiple shots 
of insulin a day and usually experience highs 
more than lows. Because my average sugar is high 
I am hyper sensitive to lows. One a particular 
day I was driving as I started to feel the 
beginnings of a low. Nothing scares me so much 
as does being in this particular situation. I 
ran a red light in order to quickly pull over 
and get some sugar. While running this red light 
I caught on camera and given a $400 ticket. I 
was told that these tickets are usually 
dismissed if they are related to medical 
emergencies so I decided to go to traffic court 
(with a note from my physician stating that I 
was indeed diabetic and that my condition was 
currently poorly controlled) and explain the 
situation to the judge. While waiting for my 
turn to appeal I found there were other people 
who had also run a red light and after 
explaining to the judge their situations (for 
example one mother ran the red light because her 
baby was crying in the back seat and she had 
documentation from the doctor that stated the 
child was indeed colicky or another woman said 
she was following an ambulance that was 
transporting her mother) she had dismissed them 
of their charges. After witnessing this and also 
my friend was dismissed the same charges because 
she was on the way back from the hospital after 
finding out she had an ulcer I thought for sure 
I would get the same treatment; after all it is 
a known fact that diabetes and more specifically 
hypoglycemia cause physical motor skills 
impairment and judgment problems and have lead 
to many documented causes of automobile related 
accidents. This however was not the case. The 
judge called me a liar and told me that having a 
sugar problem was not my get out of jail free 
card. I was discriminated against and my chronic 
life threatening disease was downplayed, 
disregarded and the severity disrespected. 
Luckily I only ran a red light and did not hurt 
myself or someone else. I have another court 
date with her on April 2nd. She said that I have 
to have a doctor state that at that exact moment 
on that exact day that I ran the red light I was 
experiencing low blood sugar. I tried to explain 
to her that the nature of the illness is that I 
treat my self and do not report my numbers to a 
physician on a daily basis. Also I was in 
between doctors at the time as I had just moved 
out to LA. I am infuriated by the way she 
treated me (she had the entire court laughing at 
me at the expense of my serious illness). It is 
not a matter of the money because I plan on 
investing more time than the money is worth to 
fight this out of principle. It is bad enough 
that the unedacated public believes I should 
just give up gummy bears and lollypops and I 
won't be diabetic any longer but to have judges 
who serve in the courts to uphold the laws in a 
country where I pay taxes diminish my condition 
is inexcusable. No wonder it is so hard to get 
funding for diabetes research when there are 
clueless people like her who downplay the 
disease and have the audacity to tell someone 
who lives in the prison of this disease that it 
is there &quot;get out of jail free card&quot;. I have 
done some research on diabetes and traffic 
incidents and found many studies that support my 
case. I also plan on getting a copy of the 
transcript from the last hearing, however my 
question is what else I can do and what help can 
you provide me with? I look forward to hearing 
from you and working with you on this issue.  
Thank you- Marianne Laplante

I'd like to be referred to &quot;knowledgeable&quot; attorney regarding insurance practices that deny benefits to diabetic patients. My brother is a type 1, not 2, his insurance company and Save Rx has established parameters in dispensing insulin that quite frankly are unfair practices, and with a doctors RX he has been denied his insulin. He spent four days trying to get clarification without of course anyone talking responsibility. His Rx is not for vicadin, penicillin, or premarin. How can the insurance company or Save RX establish 30 day or 90 parameters on his metabolic absorption? I'd be happy to take to task or set precedence in the State of Illinois for better care, especially when they are denying care that doesn't fit within their &quot;insurance guidelines&quot; versus cellular metabolism. These document driven &quot;guidelines&quot; cause even compliant diabetics with insurance, health issues due to the delay in care and the anxiety associated with it. As a healthcare professional and taxpayer, I am fully aware of the percent of indigent care and care given to non-documented citizens. I am outraged by this &quot;loophole&quot; or insurance language that once again has no intent to ensure deliverable services but to deny them!

I am not only concerned about maintaining coverage 
for diabetes care on existing health plans.  My 
problem is that when my COBRA runs out in September, 
I am NO LONGER INSURABLE. I have interviewed dozens 
of health coverage providers, just in an effort to 
get catastrophic coverage for all other diseases and 
conditions, and NO ONE will touch me. I am diet-
controlled, sugar regulated, no illnesses at all, 
and they won't even cover me with a pre-existing 
condition rider. I need coverage for emergencies!

I would like to know how I can fight for more 
insurance rights?  I don't think it is fair that 
we can't get insurance like the normal person.  
I know that almost all diabetics have problems 
or will have in the future.  Some of us don't 
have a good insurance plan to pay for doctors, 
tests, etc.  I only have major hospitalization 
and it only pays for diabetes meds, supplies and 
certain things that my endocrinolist does.  That 
is it. I want to see things changed for 
diabetics.  I would like to know who to contact 
and if there is anything in legislation to help 
us.  If not, I would like to see a bill passed 
that would help us.  Please contact me by email

Hi!  I am a Type II diabetic for approx the last 
8 years. I also have in addition to my Type II 
diabetes numerous other physically disabling 
medical conditions coupled with Severe Depression 
and General Anxiety Disorder. I am 58 years old, 
unable to work for the last three years. March of 
2005 I was granted Social Security Disability 
back to February 2003.                           
For approximately the last 32 years I have 
maintained my own personal and privately owned by 
me a Disability Insurance Policy that was not 
purchased in any way what so ever through my 
previous employer.                               
This Disability Insurance Policy through Thrivent 
Financial For Lutherans has a 30 day waiting 
period. In the past they have paid claims to me 
for one day 1985, June to October 1997 and March 
1998 to July 1998. Theses claims were all paid to 
me without any problem to me at all.             
I have two of my doctors indicating on forms to 
Thrivent Financial For Lutherans that they both 
consider me to be permantly disabled.            
Thrivent has continually refused to pay me any 
benefits back to February 2003 when I became 
permantly disabled.                              
I have retained my own attorney in regards to 
this denial. My attorney and Thrivent are 
currently arranging for this denial to be given 
to a mediator and if I am not successful with 
mediation then to a binding arbritation process. 
Can you offer me any additional help such as in 
the form of a letter that the American Diabetes 
Association is aware of this above outlined 
denial and the association will continue to 
monitor this mediation and arbritation process 
with interest.  Thank you for your consideration 
of your help in this matter. This long 3 yrs 
process so far has had and is continuing to have 
a determental affect on both my mental and 
physical health conditions including the control 
of my diabetis.                                  
Sincerely, Donald Sauder Phone 610-929-8188 Home  
P.S.  I am and have been a member and supportor 
of the American Diabetes Association for a number 
of years.     Thank you for any help that you can 
offer in the above outlined denied claim.

Your topic of discrimination only addresses ways that Diabetes has been used to block diabetics from pursuing certain jobs or to alter their work schedules to accommodate diabetes care. 

Your website hasn't covered the how employers use an employee's Diabetes as the reason behind employee injuries related to ergonomics, injuries from work-related tasks, etc. 

Everything is blamed on Diabetes and diabetics (at least this one) no longer have workers compensation protection despite how well one's diabetes is controlled!

I was wondering how to go about getting help for upgrading my 508 mini med insulin pump. Last June the doctor told me I need to up grade and I talked with my pump people and they fixed all the papers for my insurance and they said I need $1900.00 for the new pump. Now I've talked with them again this year cause my husband didn't want another payment last year and my job is doing fund raisers at work for me. So I talked with the pump people again and they said it would cost me $4303.00 for the new one now. I'm so mad my insurance is the problem they have a durable medical equipment clause for $2500 and that is all they will pay. Can You help me!! My pump that I have now is 5-6 years old and starting to alarm alot more now I don't know how long it will last. Before the pump my HA1C was 11.4 and after 6 months on the pump drop to 7.4.  I don't know what to do about this problem.

Hello,

I have a teen with Type 1 in HS.  the school will not make any accommodations even though they have paperwork with dx and have medical supplies for her to check levels and such for the last 2 years.  I am now in the process of getting documentation together for a 504 meeting i requested last week.  i have so many questions but i guess i will start with just a few.
1. how long does the school have to set a date for the 504 meeting from when i requested it last Thursday?
2. Can they force her to have to walk down stairs to the nurses office to have a snack if she feels really low, disoriented and shaky, because their policy is no food in class for everyone?  that is the excuse they gave me, she was very rude and adamant regardless of her dx.  
3. Can teachers be held responsible for providing a student with missed work due to sickness or temporary absence for bathroom breaks?  the school is trying to set the reposnsibility on another student rather than the teacher. 
4. Can schools be held respomsible for knowing for 2 years that a student has a physical disability and di not follow proper protocol for educating staff and offering a 504 when problems arose last year.  

I justlearned about 504's from a friend whose daughter is ADHD, if not for her the school would continue to make me run in circles and continue calls begging them to help my daughter rather than punish her for something she has no control over.

Please help,

of New York because I'm  a t2 diabetic. I've paid 
my premium every month for the last 16 years. I 
believe they are discriminating against me. 
Please respond as I haven't heard from you 
regarding this matter.
ThankYou

Dear Sir:
I believe my hmo HIP Health Plan of New York is 
trying to cancel my policy. If they are successful
can you assist? They sent me a new type of late 
payment notice twice because I paid 4/20 instead 
of 4/17 indicating if they didn't receive payment 
by 5/1/06  I would be terminated and unable to be 
reinstated for 1 year. I believe they're looking 
for a way to dump me because I'm a t2 
diabetic.Please advise. Thanks Daniel Byrnes

About 4 years ago, ADA was doing some work on schools and childhood obesity. If I remember correctly, legislation to address child health and schools was planned in several states. 
Can you tell me what the status of that legislation is? and what states, if any, are involved?

I won't be shy in saying that I would LOVE to contribute to the ADA because I have diabetes, my husband has diabetes, and my mother died from diabetes!  However, as long as you continue to support embryonic stem cell research, I cannot in good conscience give you one penny.  Please try to find a way to give life to diabetics that doesn't involve taking life from a fetus.

To Whom This My Concern,

   My daughter who is diabetic graduated from High School this year.  I was told that ADA has grants for kids that want to go to college. Can you tell me if this is true and if so, can you please tell me how to do it.

Also, my other daughter is 11 years old, also has diabetes.  I was wondering if there is somewhere that I can get help with both of their medications for it is very expensive.  I do have insurance on both but out of pocket for the meds are high.

Thank you for your time,

Well,  I am discouraged by the response I have 
received from Senator Johnny Isaakson of Georgia 
regarding the insurance bill, but at least he 
responded.  I am forwarding his response to me 
for your review.   
I had a feeling that this would be his response, 
and am not sure how to get him to see it 
differently.

Mrs. Lyman 

  
Dear Mrs. Lyman : 

  

           Thank you for contacting me regarding 
S.1955, the Health Insurance Marketplace 
Modernization and Affordability Act. I appreciate 
your comments and the opportunity to respond. 

  

           As a former small business owner, I 
understand that the ability to provide affordable 
health insurance is one of the most critical 
issues facing small businesses in Georgia and 
across this country today. More than 45 million 
Americans lack health insurance, and 62 percent 
of those uninsured are either employed by a small 
business or dependent on someone who is. We must 
help level the playing field for small businesses 
so that they can provide health insurance to 
their workers who desperately need it. 

           

          While some have raised concerns about 
state oversight of association health plans, I 
can assure you that patients will have access to 
the care they need when they need it the most. 
Over the last 40 years, state mandated benefits 
have increased from seven to 1,800, increasing 
costs to the provider and consumer and putting 
affordable health insurance out of the reach of 
small businesses. Through this legislation, we 
can reduce health care costs and improve access 
to affordable health insurance coverage for all 
employers by streamlining state insurance laws 
and regulations. 

  

          Under S.1955, if an insurer chooses to 
offer coverage that does not comply with the 
mandates of that state, it must also offer a 
comprehensive alternative containing the same 
benefits, services and provider categories of a 
state employee plan in one of the five most 
populous states - California , New York , Texas , 
Florida and Illinois . In this way, S.1955 
provides consumers with the benefits and services 
mandated in their state or with comparable 
coverage under another state's plan. 

  

           Additionally, association health plans 
would still have to be licensed in each state in 
which they operate, preserving the traditional 
role of the states in protecting the interests of 
insurance consumers. S. 1955 also provides for 
the creation of a harmonization board under the 
Department of Health and Human Services to 
develop uniform standards for certain areas of 
health insurance regulation, specifically form 
and rate filing, market conduct review, prompt 
payment of claims and internal review. These 
regulations would still be enforced by the 
states. 


  

           S.1955 was recently passed by the 
Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions, a committee on which I serve, and has 
been cleared for consideration by the full 
Senate. I believe that the committee's action is 
a good step forward and I urge the full Senate to 
act soon. Providing affordable health insurance 
to small businesses - the bedrock of our economy -
 is critical for our nation, and I look forward 
to working with my colleagues in achie ving this 
important objective. 

  

          Thank you again for contacting me.

One of my clients is having trouble at her job.  She is not allowed to SMBG or eat at her desk. She is required to do both of these things in the bathroom or outdoors.  
She works as a customer support person, answering phone calls, and is judged by the number of calls she answers.  Therefore, each trip to the bathroom means less calls answered.
She is trying hard for good BG control, SMBG pre and post meals.
She would like to pursue wearing an insulin pump, but was told by her supervisor the company would not like for her to wear one.
Do you have any suggestions for helping her?

I responded to an email to contact my senator and 
got this response which I just don't understand:

    Dear  Mr. Swanson :  

    Thank you for taking the time to contact me 
concerning Association Health Plans ( AHPs ).     
    I support Association Health Plans ( AHPs ) to 
provide access to quality, affordable health care 
to millions of Americans at no cost to taxpayers.   
AHPs  empower small business owners, who otherwise 
cannot afford health insurance, to offer &quot;Fortune 
500&quot; company quality health insurance to their 
employees.   AHPs  allow national trade and 
professional associations, from the National 
Federation of Independent Business to the American 
Farm Bureau Federation, to respond to the needs of 
their membership and sponsor health care plans.  
In other words,  AHPs  are a solution to a problem 
that does not discriminate by locale - it helps 
the small business owner in cities and towns as 
well as the farmer and rancher.  Any small 
business owner can buy into these plans for 
themselves, their employees, and their dependents.  
    On February 16, 2005, &quot;The Small Business 
Health Fairness Act&quot; (S. 406) to create new 
national-based  AHPs , was introduced by Senator 
Olympia Snowe.  I am a cosponsor to this bill to 
cover the uninsured.  This legislation is similar 
to legislation that was twice passed by the U.S. 
House of Representatives last Congress on a strong 
bipartisan basis.  Not only does this legislation 
have bipartisan support in both the House and the 
Senate, but President Bush has voiced strong 
support as well.  
    I understand your concerns with respect to 
preempting state insurance laws.  However, 
preemption of 50 state insurance regulatory 
regimes under federal the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act (ERISA) has allowed unions and 
large employers to provide cost-effective health 
benefits.  Also, legislation similar to the 
Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act would still 
apply to  AHPs .  This federal mandate ensures 
health care services, like a mammography, are 
provided under  AHPs .    
    A federal structure for small employers would 
bring stability, uniformity and lower costs for 
health care coverage.  Currently, the U.S. 
Department of Labor (DOL) regulates union and 
Fortune 500 company health plans.  I believe that 
small business owners should have the same rights 
as unions and Fortune 500 companies, and am 
convinced that the DOL will equally enforce the 
strict standards written into this bill.  
    In addition, I support the right of labor 
unions, Fortune 500 companies and small businesses 
to purchase health care coverage on a national 
scale.  Nationwide risk pools will allow small 
businesses to the opportunity to band together 
through trade and professional associations to 
purchase affordable health benefits.  By joining 
together, small employers will enjoy greater 
bargaining power, economies of scale, and 
administrative efficiencies.  In this way,  AHPs  
will level the playing field and give 
participating small employers the same advantages 
as larger employers and employers who provide 
benefits through Taft-Hartley plans (plans 
sponsored jointly by a union and two or more 
employers).   AHPs  will save small businesses 20 
to 30% in the area of administrative costs and 
allow small business owners to do what they do 
best - run their businesses.
    On June 16, 2003, the Congressional Budget 
Office (CBO) estimated the effect on revenues of 
H.R. 660, the Small Business Health Fairness Act 
of 2003, which subsequently passed the House on a 
strong bipartisan basis 262-162.  CBO estimated 
that enacting H.R. 600 would result in a net 
increase of about 600,000 people with employment-
based health insurance coverage by 2008.  As a 
result, they expect that fewer people would need 
to be covered by Medicaid, and that Medicaid 
spending would decline.
    In 2000, CBO issued a flawed report on the 
effect of Association Health Plans and  
HealthMarts  on the insurance market, as admitted 
through its testimony during a House Small 
Business Committee hearing.  The most notable 
flaws in  CBO's  report include the fact that CBO 
grouped  AHPs  with  HealthMarts  and ignored the 
benefits of increased competition.
    Please know that, while we may agree at times 
and disagree at other times, I always appreciate 
hearing from you and I value your advice.  Thank 
you once again for contacting me.  Please do not 
hesitate to contact me in the future if I may be 
of further assistance to you.    

Sincerely,
Norm Coleman

Below is the letter I got from Senator David 
Vitter in response to the Advocacy e-mail I sent 
with this aid of this site. Since I've never 
really e-mail Senators before, I'm a little 
upset by this response for things like his use 
of 'I', in sentences such as &quot;I am opposed to.&quot; 

I guess my real question is how do these things 
work? I thought our senators where suppose to 
vote the way their people felt, but unless I 
missed it, which is quiet possible, Louisiana 
didn't have a general vote on how do you feel 
about stem cell research. So instead of his 
letter saying something like such and such 
percent of my people feel this way about the 
subject he uses I. And I guess if we really 
didn't have a vote on it, we must have elected 
him for HIS feelings. So how do I respond from 
here? Is he personally opposed? Does he feel the 
state of Louisiana is opposed? And if he really 
feels so strongly that &quot;embryonic babies are 
killed&quot; how do I find out what he is doing to 
make each and everyone of these babies be born 
into a healthy environment? 
 
 I am not very politically savvy. I'm a newly 
diagnosed diabetic, who finds this all a little 
overwhelming. Is there an appropriate response 
here? Do I just get others to keep e-mailing him 
and try to change his mind?

Anna Marie Catoir


----------------------------
Dear Ms. Catoir, 

Thank you for contacting me in support of 
government funded embryonic stem cell research. 
Stem cell research has been a difficult and 
divisive issue for many, and I appreciate 
hearing your thoughts on this issue. 

  

As you may know, stem cells are versatile cells 
from which a variety of tissues and organs 
develop. They are considered prime prospects for 
effective biomedical research, and they are 
available from a variety of human sources, 
including embryos, umbilical cord blood, and 
placentas. 

  

I am opposed to the use of taxpayer funds to 
experiment on stem cells harvested from embryos. 
The embryonic babies are killed in the process 
of extracting these cells, and I simply cannot 
support this sort of medical research that takes 
human life. In fact, historically medical ethics 
have prohibited experimentation on human 
subjects unless it would benefit the human 
subject and would pose no risk of injury or 
death. 

  

However, medical research on adult stem cells, 
such as those obtained from umbilical cord blood 
for example, do not have the same ethical 
problems associated with taking human life for 
research. In addition, it is these same stem 
cells that have given scientists their most 
promising biomedical breakthroughs. Compared to 
embryonic stem cells, these adult stem cells are 
both more ethical and more effective for 
research purposes. I have supported legislation 
that would expand and fund adult stem cell 
research. 

  

Once again, thank you for sharing your thoughts 
with me on this issue. Please feel free to 
contact me in the future about other issues 
important to you. 

  

 
Sincerely,


Senator David Vitter
United States Senator

I have a question about the school system.  The 
schools that I am around will not let the 
students that are capable test their blood sugars 
in school on their own, they must go to the 
nursing station to do this and miss class and 
lunch time.  If they are having a low blod sugar 
they must walk to the nursing station to test or 
just treat it with out knowing the blood sugar. 
Is this the same at other schools?  I do not 
think this is fair to an independent student, 
they should be able to carry thie meter with them 
in school. Deb Stahl RN CDE

I don't really want or need a response.  I just 
wanted to point something out.  When I went to 
take the &quot;How Did You Hear About the Action 
Center?&quot; survey, none of the choices applied to 
me.  

I first learned about the advocacy center from 
browsing around the ADA website.  I visited the 
page because I read about it on the message 
boards when others talked about participating.  

It's been interesting to see the support for the 
S.1955 matter the last few weeks on the messages 
boards.  I think that support was as strong as 
it was because even for those of us who 
currently have adequate insurers, we hear so 
often from those who struggle without insurance, 
so we are aware of the problems that would just 
increase without adequate insurance.

Please don't overlook the power of this group 
of &quot;invisible friends.&quot;

I'm writing this because I'm having problems 
getting Information on getting help for my 11 
year old niece that has an Insuiln Pump.She 
lives in NY State and goes to school there.Since 
she is a very bad Diabetic how can we have a 
nurse be with her while she is in school.

I know there they have one school nurse for the 
whole school. And to me that is very scary for 
me as her Aunt to know. I feel there's got to be 
some kind of program with the Diabetes 
Foundation and Schools for Children with 
Diabetes like her's that is so bad.

Just a couple weeks ago she was brought to one 
Hosptial because her Blood Sugar was sky high 
and they had to call a Medical Center and have 
her brought there. The Medical Center came down 
from Albany NY with there own Medical Personnel 
to bring her there.

I just wanted to see if there's any way that her 
Parents and I and the foundation can get her a 
Nurse for her while she is in School? I don't 
want anything to happen to her and her Parents 
don't either. I'm Praying you have some kind of 
answer for us about this.

My daughter was dx on Febuary 1st of this year 
with Type 1 diabetes. I work and my husband 
works and this past summer I enrolled my 
daughter into School age services on a Military 
Installation for camp. They kept procrastinating 
on allowing my daughter to start camp. After 5 
weeks of persisting, it came down to me 
saying..No more maybe's! Can she start on Monday 
or not? I needed to speek with the health nurse 
of School Services and she said my daughter 
could join and I had to sign a letter saying 
that I would bring my daughter all drinks, food 
(even though it is included in price of camp for 
other kids)and Samantha would need to check her 
own blood sugar (she was 6 at the time) and 
Samantha or my husband and I would need to come 
whenever she at to give her the insulin she 
needed. Samantha did go to camp and had great 
fun. The staff at the school was very friendldy 
and nice to Samantha. So if we needed to be to 
work at 6am and Sam didn't feel like eating when 
she woke up we needed to drive to the school to 
give her a shot for breakfast and lunch.  
Samantha did have a low one day when swimming. 
The staff informed me that they were instructed 
by the director of SAS (school age services) 
that if Samantha fell asleep to just call 911, 
never to give the glucagon shot. That was the 
last day my daughter went to camp.  The staff 
that worked at the school with my child was 
helpful and wanted to learn and one lady was 
going to school to become a nurse and told me 
her Mother was type 1 diabetic and said she 
would know what to do but was instructed to 
leave my daughter alone and if she was to give a 
shot of anything she would be fired. I did fill 
out a comment card saying I wasn't happy with 
the Head Nurse nor the Director of SAS and the 
way they discriminated us. I'm not sure who but 
somebody forwarded a email regarding my comment 
card. There are parts of the email that are pure 
lies. One part being that they trained there 
employees on how to take care of kids with 
diabetes. My husband and I gave them the 
training and you can tell by the directors 
letter that she still hasn't educated herself 
about diabetes because of the remark about the 
nurses able to give shots but no insulin or 
glucagon. I think what she means is that they 
can help check her blood sugar but not give any 
medicine. Not one of these people have contacted 
me by phone and I don't know the person that 
sent me this email   This school is on post at 
Fort Campbell, Kentucky. My customer comment is  
on the bottom. The  beginning I think is the 
directors response to my survey I filled out. I 
copied and pasted the forwarded email here.____&gt;

Response to comment re: Type I Diabetic Child in 
SAS Camp

This child was the first child admitted into the 
CYS program with Type 
I
Diabetes.  Previous to her admission it was the 
consensus of Preventive
Medicine that we could not provide the training 
to care for a Type I
Diabetic Child. After researching the subject; 
the SAS Director and 
Army
Community Health Nurse developed a training plan 
and diabetic care plan 
to
use in the CYS program to care for Type I 
Diabetic children.  
The training plan included providing training on 
Diabetes; training 
staff to
use a glucometer &amp; to read a glucometer; 
training staff on using the
diabetic care plan to record blood glucose 
readings; meals &amp; snacks 
given;
and interventions done when the blood glucose 
went above or below the
parameters set by the physician.  

Staff was trained to recognize signs &amp; symptoms 
of low blood glucose - 
the
primary concern with a diabetic child.  In 
addition, the staff were 
trained
on how to respond when they recognized signs &amp; 
symptoms of a low blood
glucose; these steps were very strait forward:  
Once staff recognized a
child was exhibiting signs of low blood glucose 
they were taught to do 
four
things:  1) Check the child's blood glucose 
level with the glucometer 
2) If
the blood glucose level was below the parameter 
set by the physician on 
the
child's Diabetes Care Plan, they were to give 
the child a fast acting
carbohydrate such as orange juice  3)Monitor the 
child &amp; repeat the 
blood
glucose test in 20 minutes 4) Record their 
actions on the Diabetic Care 
Plan
Log.

The above training was the most important 
training piece in the 
Diabetic
training.

Staff could NOT be trained to do two things: 1) 
Administer a glucagon 
shot
and/or 2) Give insulin. According the Kentucky &amp; 
Tennessee Nurse 
Practice
Acts (these are the laws set forth to govern the 
practice of licensed
nurses); a Registered Nurse may NOT delegate the 
administering of 
Insulin to
any non-licensed personnel.  In addition; the 
Registered Nurse may not
delegate the administering of an injection if 
the administering of that
injection required that the person mix or draw 
up any medication prior 
to
giving the injection.  This is an important 
differential; because a
Registered Nurse may delegate to a non-licensed 
caregiver the 
administering
of a pre-loaded syringe - such as an Epi-Pen; if 
the Glucagon was 
provided
as a preloaded syringe the RN could teach the 
caregiver to give the
injection.

This is sometimes difficult for parents to 
understand because when 
their
child is diagnosed with Type I Diabetes, parents 
are taught to give 
insulin
and to mix &amp; inject glucagon. This is because 
the laws that prohibit 
the RN
from delegating these procedures to non-licensed 
personnel do not apply 
to
the family of the child.  Parents are often 
taught quite complicated 
medical
procedures if the procedures are necessary for 
them to care for their 
child
at home.  This is why the law differentiates 
between parents and family 
and
non-family members.

The Lucas SAS staff was given thorough training 
on recognizing the 
signs &amp;
symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and 
with this knowledge they
responded appropriately whenever the child's 
blood glucose was low.  
They
were taught this knowing they could not give the 
child a glucagon shot 
&amp; so
they knew prevention was the key.  The Lucas SAS 
staff was also taught 
if
the child did become unconscious or have a 
seizure do to hypoglycemia 
that
they were to call 911 immediately &amp; test the 
blood sugar so that they 
could
provide the information to the EMS responders.  

This plan required vigilance by the SAS 
providers and they were mindful
always of the child's behavior and eating 
patterns to ensure the child 
did
not have a drop in blood sugar so low that she 
passed out.  This plan
provided for the safest care for the child. 
Prevention of hypoglycemia 
is
always the standard.  The staff was trained on 
the possibility that the
child may pass out or have a seizure if her 
blood sugar went too low 
and
that the intervention for this is a glucagon 
shot.  However, we 
certainly
did not want to end up with a situation where 
EMS could have been at 
the
site providing emergency care for the child 
while the caregiver fumbled 
with
the directions on mixing and injecting the 
glucagon shot.  So there was 
a
twofold reason for not teaching the staff to mix 
&amp; inject the glucagon 
shot;
the first and primary being that it is against 
the law for an RN to 
delegate
this procedure to a non-licensed provider and 
the second being that 
having
an incompetent person attempt to mix and provide 
a glucagon injection 
could
actually delay the child receiving emergency 
care from EMS.

I do apologize that the parent was misguided 
when she was told she had 
to
bring her daughter's food and snacks.  What 
should have been done is 
the
parent should have been given the menu to see 
what her child was going 
to be
served that day and the Lucas staff should have 
recorded the food eaten 
by
the child so that the parent could adjust the 
insulin given to the 
child
based on her diet.

It is our goal always to make every attempt with 
reasonable 
accomodation to
provide care for all children regardless of 
their special need.  We are
certainly equipped to care for Type I Diabetic 
children and 
successfully
admitted two Type I Diabetic children into our 
Summer SAS Camps for 
Summer
2005. Unfortunately this is the first I have 
heard of a complaint 
concerning
the care provided, I offer a belated apology and 
I would be happy to 
speak
with the parents directly so that I can answer 
all of their concerns. 

Kind Regards,

Customer Comments:
      My daughter was in Sas camp at the 
Elementary school last year. 
It was
the biggest pain getting approved to let my 
daughter go. All because my
daughter is type I diabetic. The staff were 
wonderful when she joined 
and my
daughter loved them. The people that were in 
charge were never around 
when I
had questions. It took almost 4 weeks to get 
approval for her to go. 
One day
I was told &quot;If your daughter has any problems, 
passes out or has a 
seizure&quot;
We are informed not to touch her but just to 
call 911. What could save 
her
life if she had a low is a glucogon shot. I was 
told I had to bring my 
own
food and snacks and show up at every meal to 
give her shots. It's sad 
to
know that you don't care about kids with 
disabilities. The day I was 
told
the head nurse (Captain ?) and head of CDC told 
the cdc workers not to 
do
anything in case of emergency is the last day my 
daughter went. My 
daughter
surely isnt the first type I diabetic and wont 
be the last

Hello:
I jusg have a little story to tell you about, if 
I may.
I am a retired teacher.  I was called back on 
the first day of this school year  to sub for 
another teacher that just had aher baby(early).
Anyway, I am subbing with fifth graders--most 
all remembered a previous years @ Williamsburg 
Elementary.  We started the year by telling 
three things about ourselves.  I did tell the 
kids that I am now a diabetic(2yrs). Told them 
what to do ifthey ever saw me in &quot;harms-way&quot;&gt;
Then, I explained about how important it is for 
me to walk everyday.  Plus, I wear my pedometer.
They were very much interested in this &quot;How many 
steps business&quot;.  They were totally shocked when 
I told them how it kept up with my steps and 
turned them into miles.  Of course, now they all 
want one. 

As the kids play out at recess, I do my walking 
around the playground (2laps) and watch at the 
same time.  Just this week I looked behind me 
and there was 4 little girls walking behind me!
The next day there 10 kids walking behind me!
Now, they have started their own walking club!
They said they wish to &quot;support&quot; me by walking, 
too. Needless to say I was blown away.
We had also be speaking of heroes in class and I 
told them they were mine.  I am an ADA Advocate.
I do work with Debi Martin from Williamsburg, Oh 
on some Diabetes things. We are looking for 
pedometers for these kids.  Anyway, I just 
wanted you to know.
Thank You,
Brenda Jody

Please explain why you are concerned that bill
S.1955 will be detrimental to diabetes coverage? 
We have coverage under a small business AND though
we have coverage it is VERY expensive.  I thought
that by grouping employers together it would help
drove costs down.

I will make contact will both my senators when I
specifically understand why this is harmfull. 
Senator Nelson is a co-sponsor and I know that he
is trying to get support because he feels it will
be beneficial not hurtful.

I look forward to your timely response.

You discuss advocay at schools - thank you.  But 
what about day care?  

Our daughter is Type I diabetic and attends day 
care (she has just turned three) and they are not 
interested in getting involved with diabetes 
care.  So my wife has to go and provide food and 
snacks and then administer insulin.  

We are wanting to put our daughter on a pump.  It 
is almost impossible to do without cooperation of 
the day care provider.

How do we convince them to help us help our 
daughter?

My rep's response to my email:

From: Congresswoman Ginny Brown-Waite 
[mailto:fl05ima.pub@mail.house.gov] 
Sent: Monday, April 24, 2006 9:36 AM
To: kendra.mcconahy@ahss.org
Subject: Responding to your message

Dear Kendra: 

Thank you for bringing your concerns to my 
attention. I appreciate the time you took to 
contact my office on this important issue. 

Each year, as Congress debates the federal 
budget, liberal interest groups engage in all-out 
mudslinging. In examining some of these 
statements, it is important to separate fact from 
fiction. Some will claim that the budget 
resolution proposes draconian cuts to domestic 
spending, all as part of a n effort to hurt the 
poor and the middle class. This could not be 
farther from the truth. Since 2001, federal 
spending has increased by: 

�    32%- General Government 

�    42%- Health 

�    71%- Community Development 

�    86%- Housing and Commerce 

�    94%- International Affairs 

�    99%- Education 

Clearly, these increases run contrary to these 
liberal claims. Skewing the data to make false 
claims is shameful, but many liberal groups 
continue to do so anyway. However, all but the 
most radical groups believe that if we do not 
slow the growth in our spending, we will face 
deficits that are ever more massive.  It is 
imperative that Congress work to bring our budget 
deficit under control. 

On March 31, 2006, the House Budget Committee 
approved H.Con.Res. 376, the 2007 Fiscal Year 
Budget Resolution . This resolution takes 
important steps toward reigning in out of control 
spending, while ensuring that national priorities 
receive more-than-adequate resources. Congress 
has a responsibility to ensure the government 
spends taxpayer's hard-earned money prudently - 
simply increasing government spending on a 
program does not make it more effective. Slowing 
the growth of discretionary spending by 
identifying programs that are grossly inefficient 
or underperforming is the best way to serve both 
those in need and the American taxpayer. Congress 
can divert these funds to priority areas, such as 
Research and Development and the National 
Institutes of Health. 

I would also like to remind you that the Budget 
Resolution does not fund specific programs; 
instead, it serves as a blueprint for the 
appropriations process. The Appropriations 
Subcommittees will review each of the programs 
within their jurisdiction and if additional 
funding is necessary, they will include it. As 
these Appropriation Subcommittees' legislation 
comes before the House of Representatives for a 
vote, I will keep your concerns in mind. 

Throughout my tenure in public service, I have 
always kept an open door and an open dialogue 
with my constituents. As the 109th Congress 
addresses the many challenges facing our nation, 
I hope you will continue to share your thoughts 
and views with me. Accordingly, I encourage you 
to visit my website at http://brown-
waite.house.gov to email me and find useful 
information about our 5th Congressional District. 

It is my honor and privilege to serve the people 
of Florida 's 5th Congressional District and my 
offices and staff are here to provide you with 
any assistance you may need. 

Sincerely,

Ginny Brown-Waite
Member of Congress

I was recently fired from my job because I had an insulin reaction at work. I am an aviation technician, and I work, or did work for AirTran Airways. I worked for them for over six years, and in that time have had low blood sugars. They claim that they are terminating me because of safety, although I have never been involved in any kind of safety issue, nor have I ever even come close. When I ask them what safety issue have I caused, they tell me that I haven't caused any safety issue-but I could. I am very scared right now. Not only does this end my income and health insurance, but it pretty much ends my career. I need help. I don't know what to do. I have been a part of the Advocacy program for a long time. Can anyone help me?  If you want more information, please email me or call me at 404-966-4150.  Thank you for your time. Tom

I would like to volunteer my services to 
advocate on behalf of ADA.  I know that there 
were hearings recently on Capital Hill and they 
were very compelling.  I am a 39 year old 
attorney who was diagnosed with Type 1 only 2 
years ago.  At that time I was healthy and fit 
and was in my tenth year as a supervising 
Assistant District Attorney in Boston 
concentrating on Gang Violence and Neighborhood 
Crime.  Since being diagnosed, I have had a 
difficult time and have even had to leave my job 
as an Assistant DA.  I am in private practice 
now so that I can have better control over my 
schedule.  As a trial attorney I think that I 
would be helpful in telling my story as to how 
this disease has changed my life.  I am very 
intent in letting people, especially 
legislators, understand how diabetes can 
suddenly and radically change one's life.  I 
would be willing to speak on behalf of ADA at my 
own expense.

Eli Lilly apparently has not been selling much of
its Ultra-lente insulin and so they will cease
making it at the end of 2005, this year.  (Sunday,
July 17, 2005)

SAVE THE DIABETICS!  Call:  1-800-LillyRx
(1-800-545-5979)

 I am allergic to the BEST alternative to UL
insulin, Lantis insulin (spelling?), which many of
you are on I am sure. I know it is great, BUT I
broke out in small hives and my breath shortened
at the ripe age of 27 when my Dr. put me on it. 
I'M ALLERGIC TO IT!  So my Dr. put me back on UL
because it was the ONLY THING THAT WORKED to
maintain good blood sugar levels for me. 

What about Lente, I could use that right?  WRONG!
 Eli Lilly is ALSO CEASING THE PRODUCING OF LENTE!

So what's that leave me with?

NPH....oooooh we all know that one.  You pump
yourself full of it because it doesn't last long
enough and wake up with low blood sugars,which is
why all the doctors switched us to lente or UL or
now for some Lantis in the first place.

Not to be a drama queen and if you are reading
this far I'm surprised, but Eli Lilly has
essentially for my particular case shortened my
life with this decision. ..... I'm scared about
what will happen to my healthy 5.9 A1C that has
existed for the past 6 years....I'm scared to
think how this executive decision may not offer a
real viable alternative to sustain my life in the
proper manner.

Insulin is not an option for me....my life depends
on it.  Thank you Eli Lilly from Camden Smith in
Naples, Florida (239) 250-8760.

P.S.
For the record, I'm not against change....I'm
against uncontrolled sugars and the damage they cause.

I have wanted to be a pilot since I have been a 
little kid.  Up until I was diagnosed with 
Diabetes, I wanted to join the Air Force and 
make a career out of it.  When I graduated high 
school, I realized that that wasn't possible, 
and I can understand why.  So, I wasn't upset 
because I could still make a career out of 
flying.  Well, I have to tell you that I was 
heartbroken when I heart that Diabetes prevents 
you from making a career out of flying an 
airplane.  My questions to you is why, and what 
can I do to obtain my commercial pilots 
license?  I have had diabetes for twelve years 
now.  I am under excellent countrol and have 
never had a problem that I wasn't able to take 
care of myself.  My last A1C was 5.9 and I 
regulate my blood sugar with regular exercise 
and a healthy diet. 
I don't see how it is possible that I can be 
kept from getting a commercial pilots license.  
To me that is preventing me from makeing a 
living in what I really enjoy.  If I have twelve 
years of proof that I am so well controled, why 
should it make a differnce if I have a disease 
that millions of people live with everyday.  The 
FAA should not disqualify individual who have 
diabetes from flying commercially, but evaluate 
their health and their ability to take care of 
their diabestes the way one should.  After 
looking at a specific individual, then the FAA 
should be able to rule on whether that one 
individual should be able to fly a commercial 
airplane.  

Could someone please give me some kind of 
confidence that I can actually break through 
this unfair discriminatory barrier?  Why whould 
I be deprived of the opportunity to work a job 
that I love.  

If someone could contact me, I would greatly 
appreciate it.  I can be reached at 312/630-0693 
or at home at 630/985-0971.  

Thank you,

Sincerely,

My job was phased out on the 30th of April, 2005. 
I've had a problem finding health insurance. I'm 
a member of AARP and they refused me coverage 
because of my diabetes. My previous job would 
allow me coverage through COBRA which is $364.00 
per month. My unemployment check is $275.00 per 
week. With other expenses, I couldn't afford it. 
I'm hoping to find work soon. But it's very 
depressing to be turned down for insurance you 
need so desparately. Worry is not good for anyone 
but especially for diabetics. Criminals have 
access to better coverage than I do. I only hope 
our representatives can help us. Thanking you in 
advance for your services.

I have a comment to make.  

My mother and myself are both diabetics, Type I.  
I am on the insulin pump and my mother takes 
injections.  We are not a wealthy family and my 
mother is unable to get insurance.  The cost of 
insulin and test strips for our meters are so 
outrageously high, that half the time we are 
unable to afford them.

This is not just some type of medicine that after 
taking for awhile, your medical condition goes 
away.  This is a life or death diagnosis.  I do 
get some relief from my husbands insurance for my 
insulin, but for the test strips, there is no 
help.  I must test my blood sugar 4 or more times 
daily.  If I am lucky, I do test it 2 times 
daily, that is if I have just purchased a bottle 
of strips. When I get down to about a half a 
bottle, I only test 1 time daily to conserve on 
my strips until I can afford another bottle.  

People like us have a hard time keeping our 
glucose levels down because of this.  

We don't expect handouts, but if we have problems 
affording the cost of the insulin and strips, 
then what about the other individuals who aren't 
as lucky.  We are talking about loss of life, 
limb, or eyesight.

It's just that it's a little upsetting and 
embarrassing when you are asked by your physician 
how your glucose levels have been and you have to 
tell him that they haven't been good and that the 
reason is that you can't afford it.

It would be nice if something could be done to 
stop the price increase and in fact, lower it 
some.

Thanks for allowing me to vent a little. I didn't 
know who else to contact or who would listen.

I am in an ongoing battle with Sears that was 
initiated by a hypoglycemic attack I had while 
shopping.  I have tried to deal with this 
privately but after being frustrated every step 
of the way I feel it is now necessary to use the 
ADA's resources to help me out and hopefully have 
any other diabetic people avoid the embarrassment 
and nerve-wracking experience I have endured 
during the past five months.  I wrote the letter 
printed below to the Sears Legal Department after 
being told to do so by the Sears Consumer 
Relations Department.  The legal department 
kicked it right back to consumer affairs so it 
seems I'm in a Catch-22 situation here.  Here is 
the letter I sent to Sears:

					
		Sears Legal Department
                                                  
                      3333 Beverley Road
                                                  
                      Hoffman Estates, Ill.  60179

                                                  
                      June 21, 2005

To Whom It May Concern,

I am a 57 year old retired basketball coach and 
educator who has a clean record and never had 
been charged with a crime before February 5, 2005.

I had been shopping for a case to store my CDs.  
I went into Sears and saw a case priced at 
$35.99.  I thought it was rather expensive.  I 
shopped around and found the identical case at 
Kmart for $29.99.  I bought that case.  

In the interim I made a purchase at Sears and 
received a five dollar certificate that was good 
on a purchase of twenty dollars or more.  But it 
was only good on Saturday, February 5th.  I 
decided I would bring my receipt for the CD case 
in to Sears, ask them if they'd match the price 
and if so would then buy the case using the 
certificate for $24.99.

I am diabetic.  I take two kinds of insulin and 
Glucatrol XL.  On the morning of February 5th, I 
realized that I did not take my shot of Lantus 
(long acting insulin) the night before.  I 
injected myself in the morning.  I did a couple 
of chores around the house and then went to 
Sears.  I brought my receipt from Kmart and the 
bag from Kmart that the case came in.  I was sure 
Sears would match the price because I've seen 
them advertise that policy on tv.  I intended to 
take the case back to Kmart for a refund after 
making the purchase at Sears.  With all my 
activity in the morning I forgot to eat 
breakfast.  I'm trying to lose weight, so it is 
not unusual for me to skip a meal, however I can 
never do this if I've injected myself with 
insulin.  As I got out of my car I started to 
feel hypoglycemic.  I figured I could still make 
the transaction and make it home before I got 
really weak.  I was wrong.  As I took the 
escalator up I started feeling dizzy, but I still 
wanted to complete the purchase since I was 
already in the store.

The following series of events is what I feel 
must have happened as I do not have a clear 
recollection of everything duer to the 
hypoglycemia.  I got a case and placed it in the 
Kmart bag so I could return it to Kmart and took 
a second case to the cashier so he could scan 
it.  Not smart on my part, but when you're in a 
hypoglycemic state thinking is not what you do 
best.  I remember the cashier seemed to have a 
problem understanding what I wanted to do and 
left the area to speak with his manager.  While 
he was gone I got so weak I couldn't stand.   I 
asked another cashier if they had a sugar packet 
handy and showed him the diabetic medallion I 
wear and explained what was happening to me.  He 
didn't have one, but a customer gave me a piece 
of gum.  It momentarily helped a bit - but not 
enough.  I was very weak and just wanted to get 
back to my car where I had jellybeans and a 
lollypop for just such an emergency.  Eventually 
the other cashier returned and rang up the item 
which I paid for.  However, he placed the second 
item in a Sears bag and gave it to me.  I blindly 
accepted it and I left the area with two bags.  
The item I placed in the Kmart bag and the one in 
the Sears bag.  I went down to the first floor 
where I wanted to buy a baby item for a friend's 
granddaughter.  While going down in the elevator 
I found a computer disk on the floor.  I picked 
it up and found a store employee and returned it 
to him after explaining I found it in the 
elevator.  I went to where I thought the baby 
department was but it had been moved.  I asked 
the same employee where it was and he told me it 
was on the 2nd floor.  My head was really 
spinning now but I went up to the second floor 
before realizing I couldn't even read the tags.  
I started downstairs and realized that I had to 
go to the bathroom - immediately.  One of the 
side effects of my hypoglycemia is diarrhea.  I 
asked where the bathroom was as I returned to the 
first floor.  The same employee told me it was in 
the automotive section.  Even though I was dizzy 
I thought it odd that this same person was 
wherever I was, but was grateful he was there to 
be of service.  I figured that he was store 
security since he was carryig a walkie-talkie 
with him.  I went to bathroom and sat for a 
while.  I don't remember if I actually had a 
diarrhea attack or not.  I just know I was really 
weak and needed some sugar. I sat down in the 
automotive waiting area and a mechanic was nice 
enough to get me 3 packs of sugar from 
somewhere.  I slowly ingested them and felt my 
sugar level rising slightly.  However, one of the 
after-effects of a hypoglycemic attack is severe 
fatigue.  I found myself needing air.  I asked 
another person waiting if he could help me to the 
door as I was very unsteady.  He walked beside me 
and I went through the door of the repair shop 
outside and just sat down on the floor.  After 
about fifteen minutes there I asked if someone 
could bring my car around, or if someone could 
help me to my car so I could get the jellybeans.  
The employees said they weren't allowed to, so I 
asked if they could come with me as I still was 
very unsteady.  Two people followed me as I 
inched my way around the building holding onto 
the wall whenever possible. As I finally reached 
my car they told me I had to go back inside the 
store. When I asked them why they told me I stole 
the CD case (not those words exactly).  I told 
them I had to get into the car to get the 
jellybeans.  They took the Kmart bag and allowed 
me to put my coat and Sears bag in the car and 
get the jellybeans.

Once inside, they asked me why I had put the case 
in the Kmart bag.  I explained that I was going 
to return it to Kmart since I got a better price 
at Sears with the coupon.  When they asked me why 
I walked out with two bags I had no answer and 
for a minute didn't comprehend what they were 
saying. I told them I didn't know, that I was 
diabetic and having a hypoglycemic episode and 
didn't realize I had the two bags.  They did not 
accept my explanation and called the police.  I 
was cited for a misdemeanor and was scheduled to 
appear in court on April 7th.  I've never been in 
trouble before, have a clean record and wanted it 
to stay that way.  I appeared in court and the 
judge told me to hire an attorney to plead my 
case for me.  I retained attorney Jim Orlando of 
the firm Feldman, Kramer and Monaco.  When we 
returned to court Mr. Orlando conferred with the 
Assistant District Attorney and came back with an 
offer to adjourn the case with a contemplation of 
dismissal.  If this tactic is agreed upon, the 
defendant usually has to either attend a class 
explaining why it is wrong to shoplift or do a 
certain amount of community service.  I was 
required to do neither based upon my clean record 
and my diabetic condition.  I think the facts 
stated here speak for themselves.  I also know 
that many people feign illness as an excuse and 
that is why I was charged.  Life's not fair but  
I do not feel that I should be penalized because 
other people use a medical excuse as explanation 
for their illicit actions.  

My union benefits give me access to a legal plan, 
but the minimum fee for representation in this 
case is $525.   Now I've been hit with a civil 
action initiated by Sears to try and collect an 
additional $179.95 from me.  I am extremely 
upset, especially since the Suffolk County D.A.'s 
office in essence exonerated me by adjourning my 
case pending dismissal.  I showed a copy of this 
latest harassment by Sears to my attorney who 
instructed me to write a letter to the local 
attorneys handling the case.  A copy of that 
letter is enclosed here along with a copy of the 
letter from them that was sent to me.  To give 
proof of the validity of my story, I am also 
enclosing copies of the receipts from Kmart and 
Sears. 

Before I send a copy of these letters to the 
American Diabetic Association asking them to step 
in on my behalf and wage war with Sears about 
unfair and uncaring treatment of a diabetic 
customer, I am asking for Sears to do the right 
thing here.  I would like Sears to do the 
following:
                1.  Either reimburse me for my 
legal fees or issue me a store credit for the 
                     Sum of $525.00.

                2.  Cease the civil action 
pending against me.

                3.  In lieu of an apology which 
would indicate inappropriate actions on
                     Sears part and leave them 
open to civil litigation, something I know I 
                     will never receive; I'd 
appreciate a letter stating I am free to shop at
                     Sears again, a privilege 
revoked on February 5, 2005.  To me this will 
                     indicate Sears welcoming me 
back as a customer. Oddly enough, 
                    yesterday I received a Sears 
Mastercard in the mail. While I am tempted 
                    to cut it in half and mail it 
to you with this letter, I will hold on to it and
                   hope that after this situation 
is ameliorated I can step into Sears and use
                   it with confidence, knowing I 
am not a thief in Sear's eyes.

               4.  A policy of sensitivity 
training and a course explaining symptoms of
                    diabetic hypoglycemia and 
hyperglycemia should be instituted for 
                    Store personnel.
                   

I spent 34 ? years as an educator and coach 
always teaching my students and players that 
ethics is one of the most important parts of a 
person's make-up.  This series of events that 
I've experienced during the past four months has 
left me feeling shaken and degraded, two feelings 
I've never experienced in my life.  I feel as 
though Sears placed me in a stereotype in spite 
of my diabetic condition and until this matter is 
resolved, I feel soiled.  In addition to this, 
the continuing tension from the pending civil 
suit continually keeps my sugar readings well 
above normal.  I am not a person to engage in 
litigation.  I am not going to sue for damages 
based upon the actions taken, but I do feel I 
should not be penalized for untoward actions by 
your security staff.  I urge you to give this 
matter serious consideration so it can be 
resolved on this level rather than creating a 
potential embarrassing public airing of this case 
through an outside agency.  I trust you will see 
things my way and we can finally put this case to 
rest.  Thank you for your anticipated cooperation 
and consideration.
                                                  
                                                  
                       Sincerely Yours,


		     Jeffrey S. Schrier

Since this letter was written I have received 
more threatening letters regarding the civil 
suit.Had I not been diabetic this situation wold 
have never occured.  At this point I feel that 
without the help of the ADA Sears will turn a 
deaf ear to my requests and hope that I will just 
go away.  I would welcome a call from you to 
discuss the situation and what we can do together 
to make sure that Sears policies are modified so 
no person with a dibilitating condition ever has 
to suffer the degradation to which I was 
subjected.  Thank you for your anticipated help 
in this matter.  I can be contacted at 
631 643-8943 through August 19th.  My e mail 
address is retiredfella@aol.com.

With appreciation - Jeff Schrier

PROBLEM -- 
I received an Advocacy Alert to send to OREGON
Senators on HR 810.  When I got to the next step
my senators were not listed;  a Senator Kruse was
the only name given.  This is not correct
information for Oregon. 

If you intended for me to send it to a 
US Representative that would be: 
US Rep, 4th District Oregon
Peter DeFazio.

I KNOW who my US Senators are and have sent them
the message to support stem cell HR 810, but not
through your mal-functioning, and incorrect
Advocacy data center.

Please fix the data to correctly list for Oregon
US Senators: 
Senator Wyden
Senator Smith

Hi ADA Advocacy! 
When we are asked to send a message to our
Congressman there is always a paragraph that can
not be deleted from the &quot;form&quot; by email.  There is
a space to put in our own words - afterward. 

The first paragraph is the most important and if
they all say the same thing - I doubt that our
congressman or their staff have the time to read
further. 

In Oregon's 4th District we have a US
Representative who does everything just right for
the people.  I do NOT like sending him a prepared
statement and then my personal views. 

SUGGESTION: 
How about giving us the information to use and
then the OPTION to use the &quot;form&quot; type OR 
completely use our own words without the prepared
statement!?? 

If I send an email on my own I do not get credit
for helping ADA.  I do not need praise - I need
information and can and will use my own words. 

May we please have OPTIONS for responding? 

Thank you! 
J Russell

Hello - I want very much to help as an ADA
Advocate.  However, I am NEVER given credit re
your web site showing only one positive action
taken by me.  I write or email my congressmen
monthly with MY WORDS - NOT ADA SUGGESTED WORDING.
 I use the points that are important to ME and
that SUPPORT ADA'S point of view. 

I have again responded today, 5-12-06, by sending
the senator in Oregon who voted for S 1955
closture.  He now knows how I feel. 

Please give me credit for taking action in your
office records.  I Don't need a web site to tell
me when or what I sent.  I know what I do - Does ADA?

Here is what I sent to him in MY words: 

&quot;Your support of S.1955

Dear [Decision Maker],

As a person with Type I diabetes, I wanted you to
know that your YES vote on cloture for S 1955, has
disturbed me greatly.

I do understand that this was a complicated
procedural vote and the bill may have been amended
if both sides of the isle would begin to work
TOGETHER.   

S.1955 was fundamentally flawed for people with
diabetes and beyond repair.

I respectfully request to hear your rationale for
supporting legislation that would effectively
remove health care protections for people with
diabetes, a serious and growing epidemic!

Sincerely,

What would the ADA recommend be appropriate for 
medical staffing for a high school junior with 
juvenile diabetes attending an away camp?  
Usually a parent, district representative or 
other qualified adult has been sent; however 
family wishes to send a family friend, another 
high schoolstudent, and our inclination is that 
the adult be 18 and trained; however, as the 
student is able to handle his needs on his own, 
does the medical assistant still need to be 18?

I work for a motor home manufacturer. My job is 
in the marketing department and 4 or 5 times a 
year I need to drive a motor home. To own and 
operate one of these vehicles, no CDL is 
required. However, our insurance carrier 
requires that anyone that operates a motor home 
in the course of his employment have a CDL. I 
did not know until I started studying for the 
CDL exam, that a diabetic cannot obtain one. 

I was told that there was wording in the current 
transportation bill that has passed the House 
and is before the Senate that will change this 
discrimination against diabetics. Is this true?
If not what course of action can I take to 
remedy this situation?

this meter. Our pharmaist has also received

Deadly effects of Aspartame!
What is being done to communicate to countless 
victims?

Sweet but poison 

In October of 2001, a friend started getting very 
sick. She had stomach spasms and she was having a 
hard time getting around. Walking was a major 
chore. It took everything she had just to get out 
of bed; she was in so much pain. By March 2002, 
she had undergone several tissue and muscle 
biopsies and was on 24 various prescription 
medications. The doctors could not determine what 
was wrong with her. She was in so much pain, and 
so sick...she just knew she was dying.  

She put her house, bank accounts, life insurance, 
etc., in her oldest daughters name, and made sure 
that her younger children were to be taken care 
of. She also wanted her last hooray, so she 
planned a trip to FL 
(basically in a wheelchair) for March 22nd.  

On March 19th I called her to ask how her most 
recent tests went, and she said they didn't find 
anything on the test, but they believe she had 
MS.  

I recalled an article a friend of mine E-mailed 
to me and I asked my sister if she drank diet 
soda? She told me that she did. As a matter of 
fact, she was getting ready to crack one open 
that moment... I told her not to open it, and to 
stop drinking the diet soda !!! I E-mailed her 
the article my friend, a lawyer, had sent.  

My sister called me within 32 hours after our 
phone conversation and told me she had stopped 
drinking the diet soda AND she could walk!!!! The 
muscle spasms went away. She said she didn't feel 
100% but she sure felt a lot better. She told me 
she was going to her doctor with this article and 
would call me when she got home. Well, she called 
me, and said her doctor was amazed! He is going 
to call all of his MS patients to find out if 
they consumed artificial sweeteners of any 
kind...  

In a nutshell, she was being poisoned by the 
Aspartame in the diet soda... and literally dying 
a slow and miserable death. 

When she got to FL March 22nd, all she had to 
take was one pill, and that was a pill for the 
Aspartame poisoning! She is well on her way to a 
complete recovery . and she is walking!!! No 
wheelchair!!! 

 This article saved her life If it says &quot;SUGAR 
FREE&quot; on the label, DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!!! 

I have spent several days lecturing at the WORLD 
ENVIRONMENTAL CONFERENCE on &quot;ASPARTAME,&quot; marketed 
as 'NutraSweet,' 'Equal,' and 'Spoonful.' 

In the keynote address by the EPA, it was 
announced that in the United States in 2001 there 
is an epidemic of multiple sclerosis and systemic 
lupus. It was difficult to determine exactly what 
toxin was causing this to be rampant.  

I stood up and said that I was there to lecture 
on exactly that subject. I will explain why 
Aspartame is so dangerous: When the temperature 
of this sweetener exceeds 86 degrees F, the wood 
alcohol in ASPARTAME converts to formaldehyde and 
then to formic acid, which in turn causes 
metabolic acidosis. Formic acid is the poison 
found in the sting of fire ants. The methanol 
toxicity mimics, among other conditions, multiple 
sclerosis and systemic lupus. Many people were 
being diagnosed in error. Although multiple 
sclerosis is not a death sentence.. methanol 
toxicity is! 

Systemic lupus has become almost as rampant as 
multiple sclerosis, especially with Diet Coke and 
Diet Pepsi drinkers. The victim usually does not 
know that the Aspartame is the culprit. He or she 
continues its use; irritating the lupus to such a 
degree that it may become a life-threatening 
condition. We have seen patients with systemic 
lupus become asymptotic, once taken off diet 
sodas.  

In cases of those diagnosed with Multiple 
Sclerosis, (when in reality, the disease is 
methanol toxicity), most of the symptoms 
disappear. We've seen many cases where vision 
loss returned and hearing loss improved 
markedly.  

This also applies to cases of tinnitus and 
fibromyalgia.  

During a lecture, I said, &quot;If you are using 
ASPARTAME (NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, etc.) and 
you suffer from fibromyalgia symptoms, spasms, 
shooting, pains, numbness in your legs, cramps, 
vertigo, dizziness,headaches, tinnitus, joint 
pain, unexplainable depression, anxiety attacks, 
slurred speech, blurred vision, or memory 
loss...you probably have ASPARTAME poisoning!&quot; 

People were jumping up during the lecture 
saying, &quot;I have some of these  

Is it reversible?&quot; Yes! Yes! Yes! STOP drinking 
diet sodas and be alert for Aspartame on food 
labels! Many products are fortified with it!!!  

This is a serious problem. Dr. Espart (one of my 
speakers) remarked that so many people seem to be 
symptomatic for MS and during his recent visit to 
a hospice; a nurse stated that six of her 
friends, who were heavy Diet Coke addicts, had 
all been diagnosed with MS. This is beyond 
coincidence!  

Diet soda is NOT a diet product! It is a 
chemically altered, multiple SODIUM (salt) and 
ASPARTAME containing product that actually makes 
you crave carbohydrates. It is far more likely to 
make you GAIN weight!  

These products also contain formaldehyde, which 
stores in the fat cells, particularly in the hips 
and thighs. Formaldehyde is an absolute toxin and 
is used primarily to preserve &quot;tissue 
specimens.&quot;  

Many products we use every day! contain this 
chemical but we SHOULD NOT store it IN our 
body!!!  

Dr. H. J. Roberts stated in his lectures that 
once free of the &quot;diet products&quot; and with no 
significant increase in exercise; his patients 
lost an average of 19 pounds over a trial period. 

Aspartame is especially dangerous for diabetics. 
We found that some physicians, who believed that 
they had a patient with retinopathy, in fact, had 
symptoms caused by Aspartame. The Aspartame 
drives the blood sugar out of control. Thus 
diabetics may suffer acute memory loss due to the 
fact that aspartic acid and phenylalanine are 
NEUROTOXIC when taken without the other amino 
acids necessary for a good balance. Treating 
diabetes is all about BALANCE. Especially with 
diabetics, the Aspartame passes the blood/brain 
barrier and it then deteriorates the neurons of 
the brain; causing various levels of brain 
damage, seizures, depression, manic depression, 
panic attacks, uncontrollable anger and rage.  

Consumption of Aspartame causes these same 
symptoms in non-diabetics, as well. 

Documentation and observation also reveal that 
thousands of children diagnosed with ADD and AHD 
have had complete turnarounds in their behavior 
when these chemicals have been removed from their 
diet. So called &quot;behavior modification 
prescription drugs&quot; (Ritalin and others) are no 
longer needed. Truth be told, they were never 
NEEDED in the first place!  

Most of these children were being &quot;poisoned&quot; on a 
daily basis with the very foods that were &quot;better 
for them than sugar.&quot;  

It is also suspected that the Aspartame in 
thousands of pallets of diet Coke and diet Pepsi 
consumed by men and women fighting in the Gulf 
War, may be partially to blame for the well-known 
Gulf War Syndrome.  

Dr. Roberts warns that it can cause birth 
defects, i.e., mental retardation, if taken at 
the time of conception and during early 
pregnancy. Children are especially at risk for 
neurological disorders and should NEVER be given 
artificial sweeteners. There are many different 
case histories to relate of children suffering 
grand mal seizures and other neurological 
disturbances due to the use of NutraSweet.  

Unfortunately, it is not always easy to convince 
people that Aspartame is to blame for their 
child's illness. Stevia, which, which is a sweet 
herb, NOT A MANUFACTURED ADDITIVE, helps in the 
metabolism of sugar, which would be ideal for 
diabetics. It has now been approved as a dietary 
supplement by the FDA. It is known that for many 
years the FDA outlawed this true sweet food,&quot; due 
to their loyalty to MONSANTO Chemical Company.&quot;  

Books on this subject are available:  

EXCITOTOXINS: THE TASTE THAT KILLS written by Dr. 
Russell Blayblock 
(Health Press 1-800-643-2665) AND: DEFENSE 
AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE-written by DR H. J. 
Roberts, also a diabetic specialist.  

These two doctors will soon be posting a position 
paper with case histories on the deadly effects 
of Aspartame on the Internet. According to the 
Conference of the American College of 
Physicians, &quot;We are talking about a plague of 
neurological diseases directly caused by the use 
of this deadly poison.&quot;  

Herein lies the problem: There were Congressional 
Hearings when Aspartame was included 100 
different products and strong objection was made 
concerning it's use. Since this initial hearing, 
there have been two subsequent hearings and 
still, nothing has been done. The drug and 
chemical lobbies have very deep pockets. Sadly, 
MONSANTO'S patent on Aspartame has EXPIRED!! 

 

There are now over 5,000 products on the market 
that contain this deadly chemical and there will 
be thousands more introduced. 

 

Everybody wants a &quot;piece of the Aspartame pie.&quot; I 
assure you that MONSANTO, the creator of 
Aspartame, knows how deadly it is. And isn't it 
ironic that MONSANTO funds, among others, the 
American Diabetes Association, the American 
Dietetic Association and the Conference of the 
American College of Physicians? This has been 
recently exposed in the New York Times. These 
cannot criticize any additives or convey their 
link to MONSANTO because they take money from the 
food industry and are required to endorse their 
products. 

 

Senator Howard Metzenbaum wrote and presented a 
bill that would require label warnings on 
products containing Aspartame, especially 
regarding pregnant women, children and infants. 
The bill would also institute independent studies 
on the known dangers and the problems existing in 
the general population regarding seizures, 
changes in brain chemistry, neurological changes 
and behavioral symptoms. The bill was killed. 

 

It is known that the powerful drug and chemical 
lobbies are responsible for this, letting loose 
the hounds of disease and death on an 
unsuspecting and uninformed public. 

 

Well, you're informed now!!!! YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO 
KNOW!!!! 

 

Please print this out and/or e-mail to your 
family and friends. They have a right to know 
too.

I am actually curious about advocacy.  I was in 
an student teaching position through the Masters 
in Teaching program with Seattle University. I 
had an insulin reaction while being observed by 
my SU supervisor.  A week later I was on 
probation with no previous negative input.  Two 
weeks after that I was dismissed. I have been 
diabetic for over 53 years.  The insulin reaction 
is not the only factor in my dismissal, I know, 
but it seems to be a pivotal point.  Who can I 
talk to about this?  Is there someone who knows 
the law and can work with me?  I live in Seattle, 
WA.   

Thank you,

Hi-
I am a dietitian at pediatric dietitian in the 
dallas area whose primary work is in a diabetes 
clinic.  A colleague had mentioned that 
according to the Am. with Disabilities Act 
schools must provide appropriate CHO without any 
additional cost to the children.  In my research 
I can not find anything that explicitly states 
this.  With in these laws and mandates, is there 
anything that does state this to refer my 
patients and school nurses to who consult me 
often?  Along this same line of thought, a nurse 
had been told the school must provide juice (or 
other treatments for lows when needed).  She 
doesnt mind doing this but no longer has the 
cooperation of the school's food service 
department.  Is there something that regulates 
this as well?  

Any input you can provide me with or direct me 
to is greatly appreciated.  Thank you

I have a comment about your fundraising 
procedures.

I recently noticed on our caller ID that we were 
receiving regular calls from a caller identified 
as &quot;Futuremarket&quot;.  I was curious about who this 
was, as we are on the do-not-call list.  Last 
week the call came in while I was at home.  I 
answered it and no one was there.  Yesterday, 
Saturday, at 9:20 AM the call came in again.  
Since I have older children who are up daily at 5 
AM, and who should have the opportunity to sleep 
on a Saturday morning if they choose to do so, I 
rushed to the phone and answered the call.  
Again, no one was there.

Annoyed, I called back the number on my caller 
ID.  (361-939-8319)  I was greeted by a recording 
that indicated that all representatives were 
busy.  The recording then went on to tell me that 
they represent a non-profit organization and 
therefore are not covered by the do-not-call 
list.  Since the recording says this, I assume 
that others have called for the same reason I was 
calling!  The recording then went on to offer 
voicemail to leave my name and number for a call 
back.  I stayed on the line, only to be told by 
the recording that the mailbox was full.  I guess 
A LOT of people have been calling for the same 
reason I was calling!

Last night, Saturday night, at 8:42 PM I received 
another call from Futuremarket.  The gentleman 
identified himself as calling on behalf of your 
organization.  I told him about the calls I 
answered with no one there.  I told him about the 
recording and the full mailbox.  I also told him 
that we recently had a death in the family and 
had made a contribution to the diabetes 
organization in lieu of flowers.  Guess what he 
said?  ...

&quot;Well, would you like to make another pledge?&quot;
I was furious!  No apology for the calls with no 
one there ... no apology for the full mailbox ... 
no thank you for our support.  He obviously 
didn't care at all about any of that ... all he 
wanted was a pledge!  After commenting on his 
response, I told him I was going to hang up, and 
did.

Now.  I know legally it was okay for him to call, 
even though we are on the do-not-call list.  I 
also know that calls at 9:20 AM and 8:42 PM on a 
Saturday are within your rights.  What you need 
to ask yourself is, are these procedures by 
Futuremarket good public relations?  In my case, 
they are definitely not.  I will not contribute 
another penny to an organization that spends 
money to hire a telemarketing organization that 
behaves in this manner.

Go ahead, and tell me about how this is necessary 
in order to raise funds for your cause.  My 
answer to you is ... even though you are allowed 
to call people on the do-not-call list, don't you 
think it might be better for your organization to 
not call people who don't want to be called?  
Don't you think you should reconsider allowing 
this representative of yours to call people at 
8:42 on a Saturday night?  And don't you think 
these callers need some customer service 
training, so they know how to handle complaints 
about their calls as well as a person who tells 
them they just made a donation within the past 
several weeks?  Remember, Futuremarket represents 
YOU.  The things they say and do may as well be 
done by you directly.

I would appreciate it if you would pass my 
comments along to someone within your 
organization that sets policy.  I searched on 
your website for an e-mail address for someone on 
your board of directors, but was unable to find 
one.

Thank you in advance for reading my comments, and 
for considering my suggestions.

My daughter is 4 years old and is currently 
enrolled in the Gateway Head Start Program.  It 
is a wonderful program, however, they do not have 
a school nurse.  Last year she was also enrolled 
at the Head start.  I had to have a family member 
go to the school twice a day to give her insulin 
or I had to leave work and go give her insulin. 
They tried busing her to elementry school, which
did not work out (my decision re: nurse on staff).
This year I don't have a family member available 
and I am having problems leaving my job twice a 
day so they are busing her to me once a day and I 
go to the school once a day.  The problem is the
Head start staff is not allowed to give insulin 
even though there is a cna on staff in my 
daughters class room.  They would hire her an 
aide however that would put that person on staff 
therefore would not be able to give insulin.  My 
question is what can be done to change situation 
and where do I start.

I think that it would prove to be very helpful 
come voting time in November to know who voted 
for and against the Stem Cell Bill in all levels 
of government. If this is going to pass the next 
time that this comes up for review then we need 
to have the right people in office to make that 
happen. So I am asking that since you ask us to 
join the fight for different issues to write in 
or contact our respentatives then we should know 
who is going to work for us in the future and our 
voting season is upon us so this is the time to 
strike back.

My son has type 1 and is in kindergarten this
year. We have recently faced discrimination from
his principal. She believes that allowing my son
to be tested with other children around him is
jeopardizing the health &amp; safety of other children
at the school. After requesting a 504 meeting she
said that she would never sign anything that would
allow my son to be tested around other kids. She
said she would not risk her 700 other students for
one child (and she said this w/ my 5 son present).
I told her that I would continue to come to his
school and test anyway and she was discriminating.
This principal has a lot to learn. Unfortunately,
she does not take me seriously. I am hoping that I
will be able to find an advocate to sit with at
the 504 meeting. I need as much help as I can get.
Please help! Thank you.

I am a 46 year old male that was diagnosed with 
type 2 diabetes 3 years ago.  I also have high 
blood pressure, high triglycerides, and high 
cholesterol.  
I am writing to request assistance in how I can 
best deal with my current situation.  I was 
recently terminated through no fault of my own, 
after almost 4 years of service to the company.  
Although I have proof that my performance met or 
exceeded expectations, which was the reason 
given for termination; I may never to able to 
prove this, but in my heart I honestly believe I 
was terminated due to having diabetes which 
would raise the health insurance costs to my 
employer.  I am receiving unemployment insurance 
at this time however after child support 
payments are deducted from $310.00 I only have 
$220.00 left per week to live on.  My option to 
accept health insurance under COBRA would cost 
me $250.00 per month plus the co-payments on 
medication would come to $240.00 a month not 
including testing supplies.
I have an eleven year old son that lives with 
me, (I still pay his mother child support or she 
wouldn't allow him to live with me).  Please see 
the list as follows for the current medications.

1.	Metformin 1000MG twice daily
2.	Actos 	45MG one per day
3.	Diovan HCT 160/12.5 MG one per day
4.	Norvasc 10MG one per day
5.	Pravachol 40MG one per day
6.	Tricor 145 MG one per day
7.	Protonix 40MG one per day
8.	Amitriplyn 50 MG one per day.

In addition to the above medications I take:
1.	regular aspirin 1 per day
2.	multivitamin 1 per day
3.	vitamins, e, c, and cod liver oil 1 per 
day (each)

I exercise at least 3 to 5 times per week.  I am 
doing all I can to stay healthy, however I am 
worried because I will be out of medication by 
the end of next week and I do not know what I 
can do.  Are there any programs to assist people 
in my situation?  (I made too much money to be 
eligible for any State assistance.)  Due to the 
financial burden, I will be unable to continue 
my medications.

Please feel free to forward this correspondence 
to whomever necessary, with hope you may have a 
viable solution for my circumstances.  I am 
extremely grateful for any solutions you may 
have.  I am worried that I may become extremely 
sick without my medications.  This is my last 
hope for any possible outcome that will be 
positive. 

As I current member of AAD I am begging for any 
support you can offer, for a person in my 
predicament.  Than you in advance, I look 
forward to hearing from you soon. 

Sincerely,

I have an eleven year old son that lives with 
me, (I still pay his mother child support or she 
wouldn't allow him to live with me).  Please see 
the list as follows for the current medications.

1.	Metformin 1000MG twice daily
2.	Actos 	45MG one per day
3.	Diovan HCT 160/12.5 MG one per day
4.	Norvasc 10MG one per day
5.	Pravachol 40MG one per day
6.	Tricor 145 MG one per day
7.	Protonix 40MG one per day
8.	Amitriplyn 50 MG one per day.

In addition to the above medications I take:
1.	regular aspirin 1 per day
2.	multivitamin 1 per day
3.	vitamins, e, c, and cod liver oil 1 per 
day (each)

I exercise at least 3 to 5 times per week.  I am 
doing all I can to stay healthy, however I am 
worried because I will be out of medication by 
the end of next week and I do not know what I 
can do.  Are there any programs to assist people 
in my situation?  (I made too much money to be 
eligible for any State assistance.)  Due to the 
financial burden, I will be unable to continue 
my medications.

Please feel free to forward this correspondence 
to whomever necessary, with hope you may have a 
viable solution for my circumstances.  I am 
extremely grateful for any solutions you may 
have.  I am worried that I may become extremely 
sick without my medications.  This is my last 
hope for any possible outcome that will be 
positive. 

As I current member of AAD I am begging for any 
support you can offer, for a person in my 
predicament.  Than you in advance, I look 
forward to hearing from you soon. 

Sincerely,

Richard Myer

This isn't a question, more than it is a gripe. 
I'm a State Employee and recently I applied for 
Life Insurance with the Commonwealth of Mass. 
It's a great rate because it's a group policy. 
The insurance company is UnumProvident, based in 
Portland, Maine. Like with most policy 
applications, you have to list conditions. I 
listed the fact I've been a diabetic since age 
6. I'm now 63 and in good health. They declined 
my application, due to my &quot;history of diabetes.&quot;
Now I could almost see that coming. I had 
trouble with my auto insurance when I turned 21 
and was cancelled (due to the fact I was owed a 
rebate) and told I was subject to blackouts. Of 
course they were aware I was a diabetic for all 
the years prior to my turning 21. Fortunately I 
found an insurance company that would insure me 
for a standard fee that was charged everyone 
else. I am not now, nor have I ever been a &quot;high 
risk&quot; because of my diabetes. When I checked 
into other insurance companies about life 
insurance, I found the cost to be out of range 
for me. I'm a State Employee, not the Governor 
of Massachusetts. 
I'm sorry to have taken up your time. I'm just 
angry about being excluded from a &quot;group policy&quot; 
that I could afford, because I'm a diabetic. 
Thank you for your time.
Regards,
Martin L. Greim

Even though my mother is 72 and has had diabetes 
for over 30 yrs. and I and my 20 yr. old 
daughter are in prediabetes; I DO NOT support 
embryonic stem cell research. So I will not 
support HR810. However, I do believe that 
further research should be done with adult stem 
cells and with cells from cord blood. Abortion 
is already an atrocity inflicted on our children 
every day and I will not be a part of something 
that will harvest innocent children so that 
others can live. Not for my own life,not for my 
mother,s life and not even for my own daughter's 
life. I will stand with President Bush on this 
issue.

To Whom It May Concern,

My Daughter Alora has just turned 3 years old. 
She has had type 1 Diabetes since 1/27/04.  She is
currently attending a preschool out at White Sands
Missile Range on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  She is
supposed to be in a class with her age range, but
before she is allowed to enter that class we have
to do a training session with her new teachers. 
Which we did, on 8/29/05.  But because we asked
that the teachers know how to test her blood
sugars if they suspect a low, and because we asked
that they know how to use Alora's glucagon
emergency kit if she passes out, or has a seizure
the Nurse will not allow her to move to the next
class until we have our Pharmacy write on her
emergency kit when to use it, because we are
asking the teachers to make a medical decision.  I
have spoken with my daughter's Endo, and she
provided me the same paper work that I had already
given the school and the Nurse is still refusing
to &quot;train&quot; Alora's new teachers in testing her
sugars and giving this shot because what we have
provided them in our training session, in our 8
page paper telling them exactly what to do and
when (including instructions for everything) does
not go with Army Regulations.  We've even gone and
supplied them with the newest Understanding
Diabetes book.  The Pharmacy won't put what the
nurse is demanding on the label, all they will put
on there is use as directed, so I don't know what
to do to make this woman happy so that my Daughter
isn't held back.  Is there anything that can be
done that we haven't already tried?  If you need
it, I can fax you a copy of the 8 page instruction
paper that I gave them.  My number is 505-437-0724.

I don't know what else to do.  Please give me an idea.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Hamilton

Dear Sir/Madam,
I have several questions concerning health insurance:
1.  When does COBRA coverage become exhausted?  Does a graduate student's COBRA coverage become 
&quot;exhausted&quot; when a semester begins (Assistantship)?

2.  What happens if COBRA is exhausted at mid-semester?  The current policy is that the student can only apply on a semester to semester schedule.

My daughter is a new graduate student in New Mexio.  I understand that HIPPA option is available in New Mexico, but I could not determine, yet, if she as an individual could seek HIPPA assistance.  The information I see seems to indicate the aid is for dependent children.

I am now &quot;concerned&quot; enough about insurance coverage that I would like to become active at least in my home state of New Mexico.  Currently my wife is employed by the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna Austria and I am retired.  We do have permanent residency in New Mexico.  Can you refer me to someone within the New Mexico advocacy group?

Thank you for your time and effort.

G Langner.

Recently there were two separate incidents in 
the Seattle area (the cities of Redmond and 
Fife) that concerned me. Two people had diabetic 
episodes while driving. The police thought the 
people were DUI and used a tazer on the people 
when they did not respond. Their action has 
resulted in a lawsuit by one of the people. The 
police stated that they cannot take a chance and 
believed they were justified in their action. At 
first I thought a medical ID bracelet or 
necklace might have prevented the tazer attacks, 
but in that situation it's likely the police 
would not check. Then I thought of what might be 
a solution. Why not have a static cling sticker 
to place on the inside of the car window and/or 
windshield that would alert authorities to the 
fact that the person is a diabetic? I searched 
on the internet but did not see such a product 
available. I didn't know who to ask about this, 
so I thought I'd start with you, the ADA. Thank 
you!

I have a problem with the whole idea of embryonic 
stemcell research.  Not enough research has been 
done on adult stemcells... even those considered 
pluripotent cells, taken from the placenta and 
umbilical cord of a newborn child.  I happen to 
know also that testing is being done on cells 
drawn from amneotic fluid of a pregnant woman, 
under strict supervision.  Let's wait and see 
what comes of that, ok?  

I will not support any research done on embryonic 
or fetal stemcells!  Please do not ask me for 
support in this area of research.  This is one 
reason that I do not support the ADA, and I am a 
diabetic.  If I knew that my life depended on 
taking the life of someone else, born or not, I 
would opt to live (or die) without that support.  
My life is no more valuable than the life being 
affected for research.  Neither is yours.  They 
are no less valuable either.  So someone opted 
not to use the eggs they donated... by 
fertilizing them, they become viable and do they 
or do they not have normal cell division?  This 
is life.  This is how you and I were formed.

My nephew, my mother, my grandfather, and many 
others have died of cancer.  If I knew that fetal 
stemcell research could have saved their lives, 
would I have supported it and kept them alive?  
NO.  I loved them so much... but I couldn't allow 
the taking of a potential of someone else to live 
for my own selfishness.

So, I'm asking, if you are wanting help with your 
advocacy, please look elsewhere.  It is just 
offensive to me, and I REFUSE to support it.  I 
would appreciate it if you didn't send me emails 
regarding your need for support for this 
advocacy.  I will fill out the forms incorrectly 
and make sure that anyone that reads my name will 
know I am strictly against fetal or embryonic 
stemcell research.  I don't care if there are 
lines that the president has authorized limited 
research on... it doesn't make it right.  If an 
egg can be fertilized, it can become a living 
being... right?  You and I have no right to take 
another's life without just cause... another 
person's illness is not just cause.  Think about 
it.

Notice, nowhere did I use God's name in the email 
above.  I am a devout believer however, but it 
doesn't take mentioning the creator's name to get 
a point across that is very simple, even for 
someone who doesn't believe in God.

imposible to get insurance and if I have more 
things wrong with me insurance is worse.

How can I get treatment under a John Doe name or 
some other way so I understand what my options 
are and not risk becoming public knowledge 
withing this &quot;Privacy Act&quot; were I want things 
private about me.

Thank you

Bob

St. John Westshore Hospital in Westlake, Ohio is 
holding its semi-annual Diabetes Education Day on 
Saturday 8 October.  This normally draws about 
135 participants.  We would like a petition our 
elected officials in Columbus, Oh. on our need 
for mandatory insurance coverage for diabetics in 
our state which we do not have currently.  
Attendees would sign the petition.  Could you 
furnish a petition in proper format for our use?  
We can duplicate it if you can E-mail it to me.

Thanks very much.          Gordon D. Hall

I was looking for the form to complete in order 
to contact the ADA Legal Department and was 
unable to find it on the website.  I was advised 
by my daughter's medical team to contact the ADA 
Legal Department.  My daughter is 7 years old 
and attending first grade in the Allentown, PA 
School District.  On two different occasions she 
was given the incorrect amount of insulin by the 
same school nurse.  The last instance was on 
April 7th when 33 grams of carbohydrates was 
entered into her pump instead of 8 grams.  She 
received 1.1 units of insulin instead of .2.  
The nurse practioner at the Helwig Diabetes 
Center stated that this amount of insulin could 
easily have killed her.  As this is the second 
occurence with the same nurse we are requesting 
her dismissal and training on pediatric 
diabetes, carb counting, and insulin pump 
therapy for all nurses in the district.  During 
a conversation with the person responsible for 
nursing in the school district we asked that our 
daughter be removed from the care of the nurse 
in question.  The supervisor stated that the 
health room assistant could contact her directly 
until the matter was resolved.  Presently, we 
have discovered that the health room assistant 
has been directed to continue to involve the 
nurse in question and that she will contact the 
supervisor.  We are in fear of our daughter's 
safety and baffled by the district's lack of 
concern.  We are in need of help and guidance.  
My phone number is 610-776-0767.  Any support 
would be appreciated.

My son is 9 years old. He is on a Travel Soccer 
Team. At his last game, the referee made him 
remove his medical alert bracelet. 
The coach challenged the removal, but the referee 
insisted because it was made of metal.
 
I am not aware of any plastic or rubber alert 
bracelets.
I want him to wear a medical alert bracelet at

Aloha,
I would like to submit a proposal to my agency to 
help advocate for diabetic passengers traveling 
from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam who must give 
up their fresh fruit due to the Federal 
Quarantine that prevents movement of fresh fruits 
to the mainland US. 
Mainland flights are typically 4-6-8-10 hours 
long and meals are not always provided. I would 
like to propose to my agency that when fruits are 
confiscated we offer those on a diabetic diet an 
alternative snack. What would the ADA recommend 
for appropriate snacks we could offer those on 
diabetic diets in lieu of their apple we just 
confiscated? I believe this would offer support, 
kindness, and concern for those who have dietary 
issues.

My wife and son are both diabetic.  My wife was 
in a rear end collision with another car while 
she suffered a low blood sugar.  Now the district 
attorney wants to remove her drivers license.  Do 
you have an advocate in Iowa or Nebraska who 
could guide us through this.  Also we have an 
appeal for a second trial in a suit against a 
public school system for my son.  Five years ago 
my son suffered a low blood sugar which brought 
about a FULL BLOWN SEIZURE while in school and 
under the care of an associate who was hired to 
watch for these signs????  His brain was damaged 
and he dropped in intelligence to where he is now 
considered mentally retarded!!! We went through 
the school's mediation process after a first 
incident happened in 1998 then when the associate 
was hired he wasn't in school for only six months 
and then Jan 10,2000 HAPPENED!!!  He has not 
stepped into a public school since and we are 
still fighting!!!  My son, my only child, will 
never be the same???  But the big public school 
system denies everything.  I had to get a lawyer 
out of state to take on my son's case.  I want 
justice,  I want a voice to be heard,  I cry out 
but they hold their hands over my mouth!!!  Is 
there no one bigger than the school system to 
stand behind us????  We lost our first case 
becuase the judge was so biased against my out of 
state attorney????  WHat's up with that???  They 
have discriminated against my son becuase of his 
diabetes...can you help us????  Do you have an 
advocate who can talk to us and give us a 
shoulder to lean on????  This goes beyond just 
the school system and us....I believe that the 
county the state and maybe even the govt. is 
trying to silence us!!!  How BIG are you or do 
you get govt. funding so as that you can't get 
involved even though you do advocate for 
diabetes....don't you????  The school is way too 
bigger than I am....but if my wife and I don't 
stand up to them...who will???  For five years we 
have fought them...our own families have turned 
from us becuase of this....we can't even get any 
respite for my son becuase of this...my wife 
herself a diabetie now watches my son 24/7.  The 
out of state attorney wants a second bought and 
will move the case out of county....but 
financially my wife and I are thin.  I don't have 
a big lawfirm to back me or a big school system 
behind me.  But what they did was wroung....and 
now it is trying to be covered up....at my son's 
lost mind???  Can you help...or refer us to 
someone who could guide or just to talk to us???  
If not I at least thank you for listening!!!  
Michael, JoLene, and Joshua Gray 7123280478 or 
cell 4024904834  The hardest thing for me to 
accept as a father was when my son came down with 
diabetes at the age of seven, that with his other 
medical conditions which adds to a greater 
burder...but to have the school damage him as 
they did....how.....how...can I accept that and 
then let them cover it up????  Can you explain 
even this to ME....CAN YOU????

I live with a Diabetic Partner that suffers from 
Chronic Ulcerations of the Left ankle region.  
Health care around this area is far below 
standard and He has went to several different 
clinics and hospitals to no avail. He currently 
cannot work due to his condition, which 
continues to deteriorate.  He has tried for 
Disability several times and been denied.  As 
someone who watches him miss out on the things 
he loves, and sees him get winded walking across 
a room, I can see his disability myself.  How 
can we make them see that he is not Lazy and 
trying to get money for nothing, and that he is, 
in fact, disabled due to his Diabetes?

As of October 1st, 2005, the New Jersey Sales Tax 
has changed as a result of the streamlined sales 
tax project.

As a result, reduced sugar or sugar free 
beverages that were previously non-taxable are 
now taxable because they contain less than 50% 
fruit juice.

This change creates an economic hardship on 
diabetics, who have to drink low sugar or sugar 
free drinks.  For example, Minute Maid makes a 
100% orange juice product that contains Vitamin 
C, Calcium and Vitamin D and more than 20 grams 
of sugar per 8 ounce serving that is tax exempt.  
They also produce a Minute Maid light orange 
juice product which contains reduced sugar and 
contains the same vitamins as their regular 
juice.  This item is taxable because they had to 
dilute the juice to take out the sugar.  

The reduced sugar products are not junk food; 
they are nutritious and increase and prolong the 
quality of life for those afflicted with 
diabetes.  Previously only sodas and carbonated 
beverages were taxable because of their 
questionable nutritional value

I ask for your assistance in getting this 
discriminatory change reversed.  This may be 
occurring in other states as well, because this 
streamlined sales tax project is a national 
project between the states.

hyperglycemia. Not to mention the enormous 
emotional toll this plays on me.  I need help!  I 
need a pancreas. It would greatly increase the 
quality of my life.  But, medicare refuses to pay 
for a pancreas transplant withou an additional 
kidney transplant.  A sole pancreas transplant 
would prevent major future complications such as 
blindness, kidney failure, amputations.  I would 
appreciate any guidance on what I can do to 
obtain funding for a transplant.  I'm desperate

            Larry David Martin, 1st Judge
            Steven T. Pelican, 2nd Judge
When: April 27, 2001

Where: 1180 S. Chelton, Apt. #821, Colorado 
Springs, Colorado 80910

Why: Mr. William Dunlap was employed by Oracle 
Corporation whose offices were in the Colorado 
Springs, Colorado Antlers Doubletree hotel in 
1997-2002. Ms. Portia Ford has been convicted of 
Domestic Violence 3rd degree Assault by kicking, 
shoving, and pushing William Dunlap in the year 
of 1998 when William Dunlap lived at 135 N. 
Academy, Apt#132 by himself. William Dunlap was 
not in a relationship with Ms. Ford at that time. 
William Dunlap had later resolved the incident 
and thought it was corrected. William Dunlap 
first met Ms. Portia Ford while she was employed 
as an assistant manager for the Colorado Springs, 
Colorado Antlers Doubletree hotel restaurant at 
the end of the year in 1998. William Dunlap had 
married Portia R. Ford April of 1999. William 
Dunlap was informed that she was having an affair 
with men at the hotel around the year of 2000. 
She was caught by her employees. One in 
particular Noel Sawyer had stated that she was 
caught in the hotel having sex with a guy, and 
was put on a probation period at the Antlers 
Doubletree hotel.  William Dunlap was working at 
Oracle at the time and one of her employees 
approached William Dunlap. Noel Sawyer and 
employees told William Dunlap about what had 
happened at the hotel. William Dunlap asked 
Portia about the incident at the hotel but got no 
response from her about the incident. Then she 
changed and begun to sleep on the couch as their 
son would not sleep with her and only with 
William. Portia began drinking more after this 
time. Mrs. Portia Ford-Dunlap began to call the 
Police on William Dunlap over a period of time to 
have him removed as a tenant. One day while 
Portia Ford-Dunlap had been drinking, William 
Dunlap had to go to the hospital after she 
slammed a door into a knife on a plate of food 
which cut William on the inside of the right arm 
between the wrist and elbow and required 10 to 13 
stitches. Portia frequently began drinking in the 
early morning and into late evening. This 
incident occurred when she was arguing with 
William not to take their son to his parent's 
house to visit. Officer Buckley had given William 
Dunlap a ticket for stop and park in front of 
1180 S. Chelton, Apt #821, Colorado Springs, Co. 
parking space which was later dismissed. Mrs. 
Portia Ford-Dunlap called police and as William 
Dunlap was getting his mail from the mail box 
area after getting home from work one day, when 
Officer Kristen Buckley (who latter assaulted him 
on April 27, 2001 with other officers) pulled 
William Dunlap near some stairs to take William 
Dunlap to the apartment to talk with Mrs. Portia 
Ford-Dunlap. William Dunlap did not know what was 
going on? Mrs. Portia Ford-Dunlap stated she 
wanted him out. Officer Buckley said her partner 
was on route to the apartment. Officer Marcus 
Lehmkuhl appeared later. Police did not arrest 
nor make William Dunlap leave the apartment and 
then each officer left. Mrs. Portia Ford-Dunlap 
would habitually and frequently stay out all 
night with her man friends during the time 
William Dunlap and she were married and would not 
come home till the next day.  Finally on April 
27, 2001 police responded to a 911 call made by 
Portia from an unverified location.

What Happened?

Health: Acute bronchial asthma, heart problems, 
diabetes, back injury caused by police officers, 
head injury made worse by police officers, 
chronic fatigue, diminished mental capacity due 
to the egregious beating by police officers, left 
knee injury caused by police officers, and low 
blood sugar at 74.

Arrested For: Alleged (Domestic Violence)

Alleged charges later added are Harassment, 
Felony Menacing, Assault 3rd Degree, Obstruction 
of a Peace Officer, Resisting Arrest, Assault 2nd 
Degree (3 counts on police officers).

	On April 27, 2001, William Dunlap had 
planned to take their son Mason over to visit his 
mother after taking a nap. When he woke Mason was 
gone and he got up. William saw no note and 
neither Portia nor Mason were in the apartment. 
William began packing to stay a couple of days at 
his parents and started to pack a VCR, stereo, 
and small TV for Mason while thinking Portia had 
gone out and would be returning with Mason. 
However, on April 27, 2001 that hour, Mrs. Portia 
Ford-Dunlap without cause had called 911 and told 
police that William Dunlap was going to take her 
son. Some time later, two individuals entered 
William Dunlap's apartment, guns drawn, yelling 
show your hands at William Dunlap who complied 
while in front of an entertainment system being 
ordered to turn around and did. Officer Kristen 
Buckley handcuffed William Dunlap then came 
around to his front and said you are under arrest 
for Domestic Violence. Once handcuffed William 
Dunlap asked, &quot;What is going on?&quot; Then Officer 
Kristen Buckley sprayed William Dunlap with 
oleoresin capsicum spray in his eyes, nose, and 
mouth not just with one squirt to the face. 
William Dunlap nudged his head to get air and 
from the burning pain to his eyes and mouth. 
William was then punched in the face. Then 
another officer from the door way tackled William 
from behind to a nearby couch where his face was 
then smothered into a couch pillow.  William 
Dunlap struggled to get air since his hands were 
handcuffed behind his back and he could not 
breathe. Additional Officers also jumped on 
William and kept smothering him into the couch 
pillow. Officers punched and struck William 
Dunlap many times. William Dunlap became dizzy. 
William Dunlap managed to roll off the couch to 
the floor to get air. Then officers jumped on 
Dunlap and choked him. William Dunlap yelled stop 
several times, but officers dragged him, and then 
beat him, wantonly to his head, and back 
coercively with deadly weapons, batons, twenty 
times recorded in their reports. William Dunlap 
faded away at the foot of the apartment door. 
Witness's say he was dragged across the floor and 
struck several times before officers noticed he 
was having trouble breathing. William Dunlap 
started to have a seizure while being struck and 
was taken to the hospital by ambulance. There at 
the hospital police said he fought with doctors, 
and was not consciously aware as to what had 
happened to him.  He was later brought to the 
Sand Creek Police Station.  In custody, William 
Dunlap, yelled out the door that he hadn't taken 
his insulin for two days and he wanted to go to 
the hospital.  Despite, his calls for help and 
the hospital reports showing he was a brittle 
diabetic, police ignored his calls for help and 
he was found passed out at the substations jail 
holding cell. Police found, William Dunlap, lying 
passed out behind the jail door at the Sand Creek 
Police substation were he was taken to the 
hospital again given some sugar water with 
potassium, and sent to the County Jail in 
Colorado Springs without insulin. Police later 
identified Portia R. Ford and Maeson Gee Darnell 
Dunlap outside the apartment after the arrest. 

After William Dunlap's April 27, 2001 arrest, he 
went to public courthouse records to investigate 
Ms. Portia Ford-Dunlap record and found she had 
been convicted of Domestic violence for bashing 
another gentlemen in his head with a phone during 
the year of 1998 when Ms. Portia Ford through 
another guy out to be with William Dunlap. 
According to public court records Portia Ford had 
been convicted of three prior domestic violence 
offenses. Mr. William Dunlap had no prior record 
to April 27, 2001.  

As a result of their unreasonable force, officers 
Eric Reed, Kristen Buckley, and Marcus Lehmkuhl 
denied him the equal protection of the laws, by 
not training is officers in the proper use of 
force, authorize the use of excessive force, 
assaulted him and unlawfully searched his home by 
entering his home without a search warrant or 
probable cause to believe that a crime was being 
committed and by using oleoresin capsicum spray 
and beating him on his head and back while he was 
handcuffed and not dangerous or acting in a 
threatening manner, and discriminated against him 
by treating him differently while arresting him 
because he is black. William Dunlap is unable to 
proceed due to his diminished mental capacity. 
William Dunlap is capable of understanding 
individual and specifics aspects of the 
proceedings, however, William Dunlap is unable to 
mentally incorporate several separate specifics, 
e.g. understand the relationships and effects of 
separate specifics, and then mentally incorporate 
them within the greater picture. William Dunlap 
is presently searching for qualified legal 
representation to present William Dunlap claims 
in proper legal context.  William Dunlap has been 
relying upon procedures, forms, and pleadings 
available on the internet, as that was the only 
assistance available. William Dunlap rights under 
the Fourteenth Amendment to &quot;due process of law&quot; 
can not be met absent assistance of qualified 
legal counsel. William Dunlap is disabled due to 
the injuries by officers and has been sentenced 
on 9/30/05 for the third time. William Dunlap 
pleads for the someone to intervene an assist 
this individual to preserve violated fundamental 
rights such as &quot;the violation of his due process 
in Colorado Springs, Colorado in the 4th Judicial 
District Court.&quot;

Be sure to identify the persons, business, 
institutions, or government agencies who are 
responsible for violating your rights.

MICHIGAN, 92 N.W.2d 604, 354 Mich. 97, A &quot;void 
judgment&quot; as we all know, grounds no rights, 
forms no defense to actions taken there under, 
and is vulnerable to any manner of collateral 
attack (thus here, by ). No statute of 
limitations or repose runs on its holdings, the 
matters thought to be settled thereby are not res 
judicata, and years later, when the memories may 
have grown dim and rights long been regarded as 
vested, any disgruntled litigant may reopen the 
old wound and once more probe its depths. And it 
is then as though trial and adjudication had 
never been. 
Jaffe and Asher v. Van Brunt, S.D.N.Y.1994. 158 
F.R.D. 278, Judgments entered where court lacked 
either subject matter or personal jurisdiction, 
or that were otherwise entered in violation of 
due process of law, must be set aside.
 

In re Village of Willowbrook, 37 Ill.App.3d 393 
(1962), fraud upon the court.
Armstrong v Obucino, 300 Ill 140, 143 (1921), 
judge did not follow statutory procedure.
18 U.S.C. Section 1341, Rule 60(b) Fraud,

My daughter was diagnosed with Type I diabetes 
at the age of 4.  She is now 11 years old and 
attending middle school in Cinnaminson NJ 
(Burlington County).  Recently, I was denied a 
request by the school district to provide back 
school personnel in the training and 
administration of glucagon.  I was told that 
current law in the state of NJ does not allow 
school districts to provide training and 
administration by anyone other than the school 
nurse.  I pray everyday that my daughter does 
not have a severe hypoglycemic event that would 
require glucagon especially if the nurse is not 
available if this were to occur.  Through some 
research of my own I have found that there have 
been several legislative bills introduced in 
both the NJ Senate and Assembly that deal 
directly with this issue but it appears that all 
of these Bills have died when referred to the 
Senate and Assembly Education Committees.  It 
appears that I have hit a dead end but I am 
determined to see that this legislation be 
passed.  However, I need your help.  Is the ADA 
aware of this legislation: Bills A3663, A305, 
A2652, S1306 to name a few)?  Can you provide 
any information or advice on how to proceed with 
this issue?  Please help!  Sincerely, Alicia

I am an RN, CPNP, CDE working with a 16 year old 
boy, who is not allowed to check his blood 
glucose in the classroom. He has type 1 diabetes 
and uses an insulin pump. Recently, he has had 
some after-lunch high BG readings, and the school 
is insisting that he MUST check his BG in the 
nurse's office. Furthermore, if he checks his BG 
in class the nurse has threatened him with a 5-
day suspension.

I am new to SC, could you tell me are there any 
laws to protect student's ability to check in the 
classroom. This child has certainly demonstrated 
his interest in optimal diabetes management, and 
is being twarted by the school rules.

Please read the following letter related to an 
incident which occurred involving myself and my 
mother on 10-19-05. Please let me know the steps 
necessary to (if possible) sue for 
discrimination. 213-880-2822. Tracie
10-20-2005
 
 
To Whom It May Concern:
 
This is to inform you of an incident that took 
place at the Oakland International Airport on 
October 19, 2005. My name is Susan Cagen and my 
phone number is (208) 376-6029. I arrived at 
Oakland International Airport on the morning of 
10-19-05 to travel on a Southwest Airlines 
flight from Oakland to my home in Boise, Idaho. 
I am a Type 1 Juvenile Diabetic and utilize an 
insulin pump for Diabetes. Both the insulin pump 
manufacturer and my physician suggest that I am 
hand-screened so as to avoid damage to the pump 
by going through the x-ray machine. 
 
When I arrived at the screening center, I 
requested to be hand-screened. Aisha Taylor, a 
TSA employee, told me it was not necessary to be 
hand-screened. At that point I described the 
necessity of avoiding the x-ray machine and 
Ms.Taylor proceeded to laugh at me and tell me I 
was &quot;just trying to avoid the lines.&quot; At that 
point, one of the floor supervisors, Jordan 
(60918), approached us and repeatedly told me I 
would have to calm down because at this point, I 
was upset and crying from the emotional stress 
and harassment. During these moments, Ms. Taylor 
continued to walk back and forth, commenting 
under her breath and laughing directly at me.  
Next, another screener approached and tried to 
help me calm down and Aisha Taylor handed her 
the wand, laughing, and said, &quot;Here, you do it.&quot; 
This woman then hand patted me down and was very 
nice and told me to remain calm. By this point, 
two Oakland police officers approached and told 
me I would have to calm down or I couldn't take 
my flight. After explaining to the officers what 
had happened they went back to their station at 
the bottom of the escalator about 50 feet away. 
 
Mr. Jordan then began to write up a report and 
antagonized me further by stating that I made 
the Oakland officers come over. Next, my 
daughter (who had stood in the regular x-ray 
line) and I asked to speak to the floor 
supervisor's manager. His reply was, &quot;Negative.&quot; 
My daughter then walked over to the police and 
asked them to call the manager, at which point 
another floor supervisor approached us to 
inquire about what had happened. We then 
reviewed the incident again and I stated that I 
felt harassed and discriminated against and that 
Mr. Jordan would not allow us to speak to a 
manager. At this point, the second floor 
supervisor reminded me that this woman, Aisha 
Taylor, was a human being and we should be more 
compassionate. I then reminded him that I was a 
human being and mistreated as a U.S. Citizen and 
that it was my right to request a hand-screening 
if I felt the need to do so.
 
The second floor supervisor agreed and then 
proceeded to call the higher manager for me to 
speak with on the phone. This manager, Shay 
(spelling?) apologized and told me the situation 
would be handled. I feel that these employees 
should be required to have the proper training 
and education in these areas to avoid these 
kinds of situations. Additionally, I want to 
emphasize the fact that I was humiliated, 
insulted, and harassed and instead of being made 
to feel safe and secure, I felt discriminated 
and scared. I fly frequently through the Oakland 
airport (at least once a month) to visit my 
mother and this is the second time I was 
harassed at that location.  I am not sure at 
this point if this incident requires a lawsuit, 
as I am still consulting with my lawyer. Thank 
you for your time and assistance in this matter.
 
Sincerely,

I need to know if there is any representation or 
advice available re: an endangerment issue. 
Yesterday I had asked for a diet coke in a Jack-
in-the-Box drive thru and I did not realize they 
had given me a regular coke until I had drank 
over half of it. Due to an infection I no longer 
have accurate taste buds so I did not know it was 
sugared until it hit my stomach and the syrup 
began to make me naseaus. I picked up my son from 
school went back to the restaurant and told them 
what they had done. They admitted they were 
careless and gave me their corporate number. I 
went straight home and gave myself a shot of 
insulin. I take 3 to 6 or 7 shots a day as I am a 
serious diabetic. This could have really been bad 
had I not been able to get home and get my shot. 
I spoke with their risk department and although 
they admit it was a terrible thing that happened, 
they offer no more than an &quot;I'm sorry&quot;, a couple 
of meal tickets, and at the end of the 
converstaion, a $50 check. I am not a money 
hungry type of person that makes a living by 
suing people. I have NEVER done that at all.  I 
just feel that this could have been serious, and 
not just JITB, but all places need to be very 
aware of what they do that can adversely affect 
another person.  They had no clue I was a 
diabetic, and that is the point. They should 
handle every single customer as though they had a 
multitude of illnesses that one error could mean 
a life lost. No I am not wanting to take them to 
the cleaners, but do you think that $50 is a fair 
offer? What if the next person at a fast food 
drive in is given food that was contaminated by 
something as simple as peanut butter? The 
customer can go into anaphylactic shock and die 
over a trace of peanut butter? I know that might 
be extreme, but we are at the mercy of people 
that usually can't even speak English (Arizona). 
Our lives are in their hands .... scary isn't it?
So, again, is there any one that can help me with 
this? Anne Monogian 928-783-0237

I am not sure if I am in the correct area to ask

discrimination towards type 1 diabetics. I 
recently appled myself for the services  of the 
Jenny Craig weight loss program and was denied 
on the basis of being a type 1 diabetic, I had 
clearance from my physician, no calls were made 
to discuss my case with my physician.  Evidently 
type 2 diabetics have used Jenny Craig and have 
used Insulin therapy. It looks like 
discrimination to me. Please email me with any 
advice on how to proceed. Not just for me but

My husband and myself were just recently denied

the greatest, which was one of the reasons.  The 
only other reason they could give us was becuase

My daughter was diagnosed with type-1 on 
November 4, 2005.  She also has asthma.  She 
misses school for asthma related illness and now 
sometimes for diabetes related illnesses as 
well.  In December, I requested a 504 be written 
for her.  I went to the ADA web site and printed 
out the sample and then re-typed it and filled 
in the blanks.  There was a 504 meeting on 
January 17, 2006.  I was told that my daughter 
would qualify for a 504 but that the school 
district would not use my form and would need to 
put the information on their own form.  I gave 
them several copies of my form, anyway, as a 
starting point.  They also said that they would 
not have trained personnel on staff to care for 
my daughter because they thought a child who was 
almost 14 could care for herself.  They said 
that if she could not care for herself, they 
would call the school nurse (who is at a 
different school) and 911, if necessary.  They 
also told me that they would have another 
meeting with me once they had their 504 form 
created.  I have inquired about this meeting 
several times, but it is now March 31, 2006 and 
the meeting is still not even scheduled.  In the 
meantime, I don't think my daughter is being 
treated fairly.  Novermber 7, 2005 started the 
second quarter of the school year.  My daughter 
is in 8th grade.  She received grades high 
enough to be on the honor roll the first 
quarter.  The third quarter just ended and we 
still don't know what her second quarter grades 
were or if she made the honor roll.  My daughter 
is an intelligent and responsible person.  She 
needs a 504 plan so that everyone is on the same 
page and so that her diabetes and asthma are not 
a detrament to her school success.  I am looking 
for the 504 to be an equalizer.  Is there 
someone who can help me with this?  My husband 
and I are thinkig about hiring an attorney, but 
we really don't know what to do.  I would 
appreciate having an advocate or legal advisor 
from ADA contact me.  Thank you!

The problem is he has no insurance. He needs 
further test to determine what is really going 
on. He was told he will need a kidney scan. 
I do not see anywhere in this site for help in 
the Chicago area. My son lives in Oregon,Il. 
Which is about 30 miles west of Rockford,Il. Is 
there a County Hospital or Clinic anywhere for 
help?

what can be done about kmart? they ran an ad in 
the newspaper offering a diabetes health fair 
with free diabetes products and information, 
free diabetes samples and a free hba1c test. i 
called the phone number and they told me there 
hamilton, nj store was having the fair on 11-13-
05. i went to that store and the pharmicist told 
me the &quot;fair is buy the test strips and get a 
free moniter&quot; there was no information, no

My son is 7 years old and attends public school in
Montgomery County Maryland.  The school pricipal
requires that he go to the health room to have his
blood glucose tested. He is tested 3 times during
the school day and has become frustrated that he
is required to go to the health room to test.  He
wants to test in class somewhere or in the hallway
outside class so that he misses as little
classroom time as possible.

1. Are there any federal, state or local laws that
specifically address this issue?

2. Can you recommended an approach to solving this?

My daughter has already experienced the things 
you have listed in the letter. She is a type 1 
diabetic who has not medical coverage and does 
not qualify for Medical or any other type of 
gov. funded programs and she has no income or 
money. She has 4 children who are not qualified 
for any medical coverage either, the father 
works and makes what they say is too much money 
but his company does not offer any medical 
coverage either so the children are uncovered 
and she is too. each child has a 50% chance of 
developing diabetes which mean 2 of the 4 of her 
children could very well develop it. What does 
she do???? We have tryed all the resources you 
list but they are either too expensive or she 
does not qualify for some reason???

Can you help with these type of families, they 
are living on very little income, they are poor 
but yet we qualify them as rich? living on about 
1O.00 an hour, how does that make them not 
qualify for serviece???

These &quot;Please contact your _________ TODAY&quot; e-
mails, like the one I got this morning, are a 
problem for me.  Although I check my e-mail most 
days, I sometimes miss a day.  Also, people on 
the West Coast are at a disadvantage since we are 
three hours behind the East Coast.  I'm not 
always able to check my e-mail early in the day; 
it was almost noon when I checked my e-mail, so 
it was nearly 3:00 in D.C.  Only one Senator's 
office had a person answering her phone when I 
called; in less than two hours, it will be the 
end of their phone-answering day.  Your e-mail 
today, regarding preventing diabetes prevention 
funding cuts, spoke of things taking a turn for 
the worse last week.  How about more notice, when 
possible??  I really want to help, but I need a 
meaningful opportunity to do so.

gave me a book telling me 
how long they pay disability and insurence and i 
schoold of known from that 
book i recieved 17 years ago . I only had money 
to pay for a few days of one 
of my perscriptions the agumneton  I did not fill 
my blood pressure or my 
lantis perscriptian  but they all told me it was 
not there problen and it 
was in my hand book when i got hired . my 
insurence has payed for less and 
less ovet the past two years i dont even have a 
uptodate blood monotor  and 
now i have missed a eye oppointment for laser 
surgery because i have no 
insurence  I have a burst blood vessel in my

problems in my eyes. I had 
a social security hearing on Sep 12 2005 that 
went quite well  it took two 
years for the hearing and finally a judge form 
California came to pueblo and 
conducted my hearing. it was judge Dale Garlwell 
from the LA  area. he told 
me I would hear form him in less than 30 days and

I have been a diabetic for almost 17 years. I 
became diabetic at 29 with no warnings though my 
brother was a juvenille and my mom had adult 
onset. My glucose levels seem to always run low 
and I have had too many insulin reactions to 
name!  Lowest I can recall was 18!  Over the 
past year I have been sick often with 
reactions.  I had a few on the job as well and 
once had to be taken to the ER from work. I go 
on periods of time where I am fine but then 
I 'crash' multiple times a day for a number of 
days.  This usually leads to new medicine 
routines (cut this, add that).  Problem is that 
it effect my job this year because I was out. I 
have NEVER had an issue like this with work in 
the 27 years I have worked. Last week I had a 
very bad week!  I am now being told that Human 
Resources wants me to take these days without 
pay which I cannot afford to do! I saw my doctor 
for 3 days in a six day period and he did not 
want me to go to work until I was stabilized. I 
did see a specialist in the fall who wants me to 
go on the pump except that my job will not allow 
me to come in late for and make up the time for 
appointments and the doctor does not have any 
evening hours or weekend hours.  I would be 
willing to make up the time, etc. but that is 
not an option.  Are there no rights for me???  
If I do not receive proper treatment I will 
continue to get worse - If I do go for proper 
treatment that will mean I must come in late on 
appt days and then my job is in jeprody!  I have 
cried for three nights over this and do not know 
where to turn!  Please offer me some advise.  I 
work for a very large company that has a medical 
department - WOuld it be a good idea fo r me to 
get a physical there to prove the severity of 
this situation?

Not a problem with your website but I am 
wondering if the ADA is lobbying to get better 
coverage for insulin needs with the new Medicare 
D drug plan. My insulin costs, based on pharmacy 
quoted prices are $ 223.00 per month. This does 
not include syringes or needles or other meds. 
Even with expensive plans that offer coverage 
with copay, these costs drive us to the &quot;donut&quot;

Is there and if not an issue in front of the state and federal government about individual healthcare on regarding diabetes.  Dennis and I sterongly believe that individual insurance companies and the State of Missouri and ALL States included Should NOT be discrimated against if someone is born or developes Diabetes through out their lives.  We strongly believe that we as many other people dealing with some type of diabetes should be allowed and be approved for individual healthcare. Question to ALL LEVELS OF GOVERMENT OFFICIALS- Why NOT PASS a BILL on ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS with Diabetes to get Private Insurance?  Dennis(my husband) is now Retired-Disabled(from a work injury) with Diabetes and is having to pay $800-$900 dollars a month until his Medicare becomes eligable in @ years. I to am disabled, so this makes our income being stretched for the necessities needed.

terminated from his job for a diabetes related 
issue.
He worked for Borders Books and Music as a 
supervisor
and was terminated for eating a Lemon Bar (64 
cents)
writing and failing to pay for it. He ate the 
lemon
bar when he began to feel ill early in the 
morning
before the store had opened. His blood sugar was 
low
so he ate the lemon bar to remedy it. The 
register was
not open at the time so he wrote the I.O.U. and 
placed
it on top of the register with the intention of 
paying
the 64 cents later. He forgot and was later 
terminated
for theft. 
The official reason was theft but the management 
at
the Bloomington-Normal Borders in Illinois has 
also
had a history of punishing the same employee for
serious medical issues. Previously he had been 
written
up for missing work due to a heart attack. He was
hospitalized and upon his return to the store he 
was
written up for &quot;unexcused absences.&quot; 
I write you out of concern for a friend who will 
soon
loose his health insurance if he does not regain 
his
employment. I will be sending a letter to the 
Borders
Coporation and would like to include a letter 
from the
ADA, perhaps one that simply states the rights of
workers with Diabetes. With your permission I 
would
include your statement as part of that letter. 
If you
need more specific information please let me 
know and
I will provide it. But if you cannot provide a 
letter
of that kind addressed to the Borders 
Corporation I
understand. 
Either way I was wondering if you could e-mail 
me some
overview of workers rights concerning Diabetes or
other illnesses in general which I would not 
include
as part of the letter without your written 
permission.

Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from 
you
soon, Happy Holidays, Charlie Mulvey

My husband has type 2 diabetes.He lost his job 
and currently has no insurance.He has cut back 
on his insulin, and consequently his sugar 
levels are rising.He has gone to the health 
clinic to get help, but they said he has to wait 
for a caseworker to contact him before he is 
seen even.Meanwhile he is almost out of 
insulin.How do I get him his medicine? Is there 
a prgram or anything I can check into for help?

I am the only Diabetic at my workplace. I have a
problem with my employer not giving breaks so that
I can test my blood sugar levels and eat.I gave
them a doctors not requesting my breaks.Then my
hours were cut from my normal (36-38hrs, I was
normally scheduled 3 to 4 9hr shifts a per week) 
down to (four 2 1/2hr shifts a total of 8hrs for
that week).I was  also told that I had only 2
minutes to test my sugar (that was all the time
they could allow me) other than before my shift
and after.When I questioned her requarding my
hours,she simply stated that it was easier than
scheduling  my breaks. 
   How do I find on your website if there is any
laws that govern and prevent this kind of
dicrimination against an employee and any laws
that trequest the employers to educate the
managers how to properly deal with these issues?

My name is Natasha Garcia, I'm ten years old. I 
was diagnosed with diabetes in May 2001. Since 
then I have been committed to bringing awarenes, 
education and advocacy for the diabetic children 
in Hawaii. Last year I workeed with our Local 
Chapter on a Bill to allow Glucagon to be 
administered in the Public Schools. The Bill was 
isgned in to Law July 8, 2005.

Now I want to let you know about about my idea 
to establish a Speical Fund for Medical Rserach 
to Cure Diabetes and Chronic Diasease that 
affect the Children of Hawaii, this initiative 
for legislative Action has been introduced and 
will be consider during our 2006 Session at our 
State Capitol.

I at first I, wanted it to be only for Diabetes 
Cure Reseach, as it was indicated in House Bill 
2110, But, the  Legislators that helped 
introduced this idea, felt that it would have a 
better chance with a wider appeal by also 
including the words Chronic Diseases on the Bill.

Two additional Bills were drafted and they are:
HB2073 and SB2165.

The idea is to allow the Hawaii taxpayers to 
donate money from their income tax return to the 
Special Fund. This Bills are now posted and 
referrals have been made for other committees to 
review. 

The SB2165 was submitted to the Health and the 
Ways and  Means Committees for their review.The 
HB2110 and HB2073 have also been referred to the 
Health and Finanace Committees as well. Both the 
Senate and The House have not scheduled Hearings 
as of yet.

I will keep you posted on the progress of this 
initiative. Please give my regards and my 
warmest Aloha to Ms. Lynn B Nicholas whom I had 
the pleasure of meeting last year when she 
visited Hawaii.


Sincerely,


Ms. Natasha Garcia

Dear Sirs,
       Does a Child have any rights who attend a 
Private Christian School when it comes to their 
medical needs? 
        Last Friday my daughter was given an in 
school suspension that morning with out warning. 
They had placed her in a small room with the door 
shut, across the hall of their office. She was 
with out food, drink or her insulin/kit. In her 
Service Plan states the importance of her 
frequent breaks from sitting due to her bleeding 
disorder, sitting too long can cause her internal 
bleeds. They had her sitting in a metal chair. 
Her service plan also states for her to have 
juice and water, and other snacks when needed. 
The school was given a note from her doctor. She 
was placed in this room at 8:40 and no one came 
in there to check on her until 9:25. Melissa has 
been know to have highs and lows in a short 
period of time, and being under stress. See the 
principal, thinking that they only went some 
information from her. Then it turn out to be an 
in school suspension, doesn't help keep her 
levels stable.
      I feel that all for the sake of discipline, 
which was because she wouldn't tell on a boy that 
had made a not so nice call to a girl. Being 
place in that room, by herself, with out even 
asking her how she is feeling or if she needs 
anything. She was told to go to her looker, to 
get a book, and get into that room. Were she was 
planning to stay until 1:15.
      Talked to Jim Myers, board of education of 
Troy City School., he said because this school is 
private, they can't do anything about it. 
       Troy Christian High School has totally 
dismissed my daughter's service plan, something 
that was made to protect her. 
     Does she have any rights? 
Who can I file a complete to?
If you have any information, I would appreciate 
it. 
Thank You,
Dorothy Stover (mother)

Hello,

I am an attorney in Buffalo Grove, IL.  I
represent the plaintiff (a type 1 diabetic) in
federal lawsuit against two police officers
alleging a violation of my client's civil rights.
 It is a Section 1983 action alleging deprivation
of medical treatment.

My client was in police custody for questioning
about a burglary (he was ultimately charged and
pled guilty).  Plaintiff advised the police
officers of his need for food and insulin on
multiple occassions.  He was given food, and was
led to believe insulin would be supplied. 
However, plaintiff was held in custody for about 6
hours without insulin.  He was finally transported
to the hospital - his glucose was 740, and he was
hospitalized for two and a half days.

I am interested to know if the ADA/Advocacy Action
Center would have an interest in this case on an
amicus basis or otherwise.  I would be pleased to
discuss the case with you at greater length.

My 17 year old daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes Feb 9, 2006. She injects insulin 4-5 times daily, watches her diet and has blood sugar readings consistently over 200. Her endocrinologist recommended she try an insulin pump. Blue Shield of California denied her claim and my greivance claim. What steps should I take to overturn their ruling?

I was recently diagnosed with diabetes and am 47 
years old. I have long term disability insurance 
through my employer. I am concerned about losing 
my that insurance.They have already put a lid on 
how much coverage I can get after being 
diagnosed with clinical depression.  Can they 
deny my coverage because of the diabetes? I 
don't want to ask as it would call attention to 
myself.

I would like to make someone aware of THE ANSWER 
ASSOCIATION. A 501-c-3, that through there 
ASSOCIATION membership offers to EVERYONE AND 
ANYONE there GROUP INSURANCE AND MEDICAL SAVINGS 
PROGRAM. This program has a tremendous amount of 
insurance in it and for people who have 
ailments, like us (the uninsurable), this is the 
best anyone is going to get with diabetes and it 
is very low in cost. Someone (VERY HIGH UP IN 
THE DIABETES ASSOCIATIONS) needs to know that 
this is available so anyone with diabetes can 
still obtain insurance even though they have 
been diagonosed with diabetes; or anything else. 
THE ANSWER ASSOCIATION is a very large group 
association membership program (like yourself) 
and YOU SHOULD CONSIDER DOING AN ARTICLE ON 
THERE PROGRAM TO LET PEOPLE KNOW WHO HAVE 
DIABETES THEY DO HAVE A NEW INSURANCE OPTION. 
FYI,,,,,,,

My six year old son was recently diagnosed with 
Type 1. While we receive excellent support from 
our school system, and from our school nurse in 
particular, the YMCA Super Summer day camp (in 
Livingston, NJ) he attended last year has refused 
to accept him because their insurance company 
won't allow counselors and staff to administer 
injections.  Are they legally able to do this?

Hello:  Has your organization (or another) ever 
looked into proposing an excise tax on the two 
additives to processed foods which contribute 
the most to obsesity and poor heart health:  
high fructose corn syrup and transfats?

A federal excise tax on these ingredients, 
applied to their domestic production or import, 
could be considered similar to excise taxes on 
alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.  These are 
sometimes called &quot;sin taxes&quot;.  

In the case of these food additivess, an excise 
tax would accomplish two things:

1.  It would raise the price for producers  
using them in processed foods, and raise the 
purchase price for consumers.  The price 
increase should stimulate both producers and 
consumers to look for healthier alternatives.

2.  It would produce revenue that can help 
offset the societal costs of obesity.

Most excise taxes are levied by states, but 
could be imposed by the federal government.  I 
believe both states and the feds impose a gas 
tax -- another exise tax on a product that 
imposes high social costs.

Thank you for your thoughts on this idea.

If there is another organization more 
appropriately involved in this kind of proposal, 
please let me know.

I have a question on insurance coverage for

with type 2 and had to purchase a blood glucose

a prescription for oral medication.

I had a prescription for the supplies from my 
doctor.  However, insurance denied the coverage.

I later called Blue Cross Blue Shield of 
Florida, my company's insurance provider.  I was 
then told that the supplies come under major 
medical and to use one particular firm that 
would take care of everything.

My question:  Isn't there a much higher

The ADA has it completely wrong about school
nurses, the ANA, and the new position statement
regarding registered nurses in the public school.

I find it personally offensive as a diabetic and
as a registered nurse who happens to be a school
nurse that anyone would think a school nurse would
jeopardize a student's health at school.   When a
school nurse is absent from school, there are
substitutes available to fill in.   There are also
laws that require that other people on the campus
besides the school nurse be trained in dealing
with a student's diabetes in case the nurse is
busy with a different emergency or off campus.  

Did you even consult a school nurse about this
before jumping into a letter writing campaign?  
That is disingenuous at best.  It makes me
question the reliability of every &quot;issue&quot; on your
website and reluctant to contact any more of my
representatives based on the information you provide.

By the way, senator Kay Bailey Hutchison sent me a
form letter in response to my complaints about S.
1955.   It didn't even address the fact that I was
against it.   It just said she supported it and
thanks for contacting her office.   It appears
they didn't even read my letter.

I read the article sent out by you guys:

*****The recent discussions about fluffernutter
sandwiches in Massachusetts has brought attention
to the issue of school nutrition, but has 
also clouded the real health issues that are at
hand -- issues that would be 
addressed by the passage of school nutrition
legislation.

                    This debate really isn't about
a fluffernutter sandwich, but about whether
schools should be a place to foster healthy
eating.  In light of the overweight and obesity
epidemic in America (the majority of American
adults now fit in one of these two categories), it
is critical that our policymakers 
begin to turn things around to lower the risk for
cancer, heart disease and diabetes.

                    The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention estimate that 
1 in 3 children born in the year 2000 will have
diabetes -- they are predicting 
that 1 in 3 of today's six year olds will end up
with diabetes!  We can't allow 
current trends to continue if we want our children
to live healthy and 
productive lives.  Please help us prevent the
diabetes epidemic by urging your 
state senator and state representative to improve
nutrition in our schools.****

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why didn't you clarify between Type 1 and
Type 2 Diabetes?  My 7 year old did not get Type 1
Diabetes at the age of 5 because her diet and
lifestyle were not healthy.  She got Type 1
Diabetes because it is an AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE!  

In the future, please make sure that you clarify
that Type II Diabetes is typically caused by a
poor diet/lack of exercise so that my daughter
doesn't constantly hear negative remarks about WHY
she got diabetes (&quot;well, that's why I don't let my
daughter have soda...so that she won't get
diabetes like your daughter&quot;.)  Do you know how
that pains me to hear on an almost weekly basis?!
 The simple fact is that my daughter never had
sodas either...she got Type ! because her immune
system attacked her pancreas.  She was the epitome
of health at diagnosis...she certainly wasn't
cramming herself full of Happy Meals and playing
video games all day long.

I appreciate your efforts to get the word out on
the epidemic of diabetes, but please don't hurt
the Type 1 diabetics in the process.

Thanks,
KB

it without first discussing it with us.  We had

My husband and I are 55 and 56 and lost both our

would have to pay premiums for one year before I 
could be covered because I have Asthma.  He and I 
haven't been hospitalized for our conditions yet 
so we couldn't get any insurance.  
Blue Cross and Blue Shield wouldn't cover us at 
all.  We do not have any coverage at all now.  I 
just pray that neither one of us get seriously 
ill and have to go to the hospital.  Can anything 
be done about this discrimination toward us?

I am part of the Community Action Agency of 
Oklahaoma City/Oklahoma and Canadian Counties.  
We are a non-profit orginization, and we have a 
new program called Rx for Oklahoma.  This is 
designed to assist clients who have no 
prescription coverage and moderate to low 
income. We prescreen on the basis of 200% of the 
current Federal Poverty Guidelines, and wheather 
or not there is actually prescription coverage.  
If basic eligibility requirements are met, then 
we procced with the process. 

We are associated with RxAssist 
patient/medication tracking software, that has 
partnered with over 120 drug manufacturing 
companies.  Thes compainies have Prescription 
Assistance Programs, many of them can be found 
on PAPRx.org. We are listed as a resourse with 
this company as well. 

What makes us different from PAPRx is that we 
have direct links to the manufactures online 
application forms, and can process several at 
one time for a client.  We make it a priority to 
help the client, obtain the medications they 
need and secure their doctors participation in 
the process.  We DO NOT charge any fee for the 
application process.

We want to help raise awareness about this 
program in the state of Oklahoma, our 
legislators have been gracious in funding the 
project statwide through the end of June, and 
have a refunding bill on the floor, to refund 
the program for the remainder of the year. We 
are dedicated to making this progect work. 

If you could please pass this information along 
to what ever area or department could list us as 
a free resource.  We want to help the great 
people of oklahoma and would like to help raise 
awarness to our law makers, on the number of

I work as a part-time instructor in a local 
community college. I am also a single parent 
with two daughters in high school. I had worked 
at this institution for 3.5 years with 
outstanding evaluations from both the students 
and the administration. Last fall I could no 
longer afford my medication (Actos) or testing 
supplies. As a result my blood glucose levels 
rose to a high of 517. As a result of my high 
glucose levels I became very irritable even 
angry with some of my superiors over an issue of 
control of intellectual property rights in early 
November. I was admitted to the hospital for 
four days during this time. The administration 
waited until January decided to give me only one 
class instead of my normal load of 4. When I ask 
about the reduction in classes I was informed by 
my superior that I was &quot;lucky to have a class at 
all.&quot; I was told that I must sign a three page 
document that basically stated that this 
institution did not discriminate against people 
with diabetes or I wouldn't be hired at all. I 
was also informed by my superior that I would 
not be hired for the summer as I usually am and 
that their may be something for me in the fall 
but that I should wait until August to talk to 
the Vice-President for Instruction to see. 
Before this I was well liked by the students and 
staff and was given as much work as they could 
give me. I feel as though behavior was brought 
on by my diabetes and that the school is quite 
possibly retaliating against me. What if any 
suggestions might you have for me?

only on working and we just don't have the money
we need for medical bills. My daughter just had
her tonsils removed and 4 teeth pulled as well as
we just got her on the pump. we are now dealing
with her starting school. My oldest daughter is
beginning to act up now. We are all going crazy
and it is effecting my work performance. I drive a
fork lift . In December I ran into a support pole
and almost los t my job all because we are so
exhausted. I have FMLA but I can not afford to
stay out of work. I am on 2nd shift and can not
help my wife look after my children and am afraid
it is too much for her.To make matters worse after
I had just gotten things under control at work I
hit another pole. I may loose my job. I told my
employers about my problems and that I would
enroll in the companies employee assistance
program and get my family some counciling to
better manage out household and get rid of some of
the stress . I even wrote that down on the
accident report. I have been driving a forklift
since 1994 and never had anything like this happen
to me before my daughter was diagnosed. Are there
any laws that could protect me in this situation?
I know I damaged company property and I will be
penalized but if I get penalized I could loose my
job for any little mistake and then were would I
be. We need all the help we can get. My wifes mom
is wheel chair bound and can not help us no one is
willing to help look after our daughter. I dont
know how soon you read these but I need help
FAST!!! I may even need a job and I don't know 
who else to turn to. I know you can help with
things like this. I need someone on my side to
help me defend myself against this company. I am
the on second shift with only one other person. If
I have to leave it is a big deal . I was told I
could leave at any time and take care of my child
but that is FMLA. I need first shift so I can help
my wife at night. I am limited due to irratable
bowel syndrome I can not do jobs that require me
to stay in one place without being able to go to
the bathroom. If I got fired no one would hire me
I have psoriasis as well. No one wants people like

My 88-year-old mother resides in an assisted 
living facility where they monitor her blood 
sugar and administer insulin on a sliding 
scale.  She is legally blind and but for this 
need, she would not have to live in an  an 
assisted living facility.  Would Medicare pay 
all or part of her expenses there?

Would Medicare cover her care at home with 
visits from a home health aide?

How do you suggest I proceed?

I have a type-1 diabetic since 1985 at that time i
was medically discharged from the US Army and soon
after started working at the US Postal Service
then recently I began having eye problems and for
a short time was completely blind, and by the
Lords hands have began to get some of my sight
back. Because of that I have medically retired
from the Postal Service and have a lot of time on
my hands and cant think of a better way to spend it.

You sent me an alert this morning to call the governor of Illinois, Rod Blagojevich about SB360. I recently had a situation that this law would apply to. I fought the Joliet school district about my son's care at school, and the end result, after involving the Illinois state board of education, the department of civil rights, the school board, and they even hired their own attorney, was that they have to provide someone who can care for him at school. They have to have someone who can give insulin, or glucagon,and knows how to care for someone with diabetes. They didnt feel comfortable having a trained staff member do that, they wanted a nurse to do it. The problem was his school shares a nurse with 3 other schools. I told them the choice was theirs, either someone trained to care for him, or a nurse, but someone had to be able to do it. Well, end result is that there is a full time nurse at his school now. i think it is the best because many people dont understand diabetes or they are scared. So this law mandates a nurse, and the school is mandated to provide. I dont understand why this law would be a bad thing, maybe you could explain?

I was diagnosed w/ diabetes in 1968.  In 1970, at 
age 16, I obtained my first driver's license in 
the State of illinois.  At that time, applicants 
were asked specifically about certain conditions 
such as diabetes, epilepsy, and drug additicion.  
I responded that I had diabetes.  In turn, I was 
instructed to get a form filled out my my 
physician in which he stated whether or not I was 
medically capable of operating a vehicle.  

Each time I renewed my license, I had to have the 
physcian complete such a form.

I notice that the state now asks if the applicant 
has a medical condition that may impede their 
ability to operate a motor vehicle.  As I have 
had no (ZERO) instances of driving impairment due 
to my diabetes (or any other reason) over the 
past 37 years, have no other chronic illnesses, 
do not drink or use drugs (except insulin), etc., 
I feel I should be able to answer this question 
as &quot;NO.&quot;  However, when I attempted to do so, the 
folks at the driver's license facility refused to 
renew my license.  If I were a newly diagnosed 
diabetic, I would certainly answer &quot;NO&quot; and would 
not be questionned on that response.

I feel that as someone who has a proven track 
record of successful control of my diabetes I am 
being &quot;punished&quot; rather than rewarded by the 
state's stance.  IF they were to currently 
ask, &quot;Do you have diabetes, epilepsy, etc.&quot; I 
would certainly answer honestly and say yes.  If 
I had experienced complications or other diabetes-
related instances that impaired my ability, I 
would answer yes.  I now honestly answer their 
question and am basically called a liar because 
under the old &quot;rules&quot; I was honest.

What is the ADA's position on this kind of 
situation?  Where do I file a complaint about 
what I consider to be an unfair practice by the 
state. 

Thank you for your assistance.  I have been a 
member of ADA for many, many years and appreciate 
the advocacy actions and positions taken by the 
association on behalf of me and other diabetics.

I thought this email was to contact you with a 
question?  
I am interested in finding help, like $600.00, to 
receive the training DVD's for 'Heaven Scent 
Paws'.  My insurance company and Medicare, I'm 
sure are not going to approve it.  My doctor will 
help me, but he said he needs proof that a 
service dog will help me.

I have my own reliable dogs for training.  And 
yes, they can be trained to let me know when my 
sugars are low.  

I have been insuling dependent for over 30 years 
and on the pump now, but I still have trouble 
relizing my sugars are low.  I have had a heart 
attack and suffer from depression due to the 
diabetes.  My sister as well, has it.  She has 
suffered lazer surgery on her eyes three times 
and still may go blind.  Oh, I also have high 
blood pressure.
I cannot afford my copays to get my drugs so I 
know a can't afford this program, but I need it 
desperately.  

I used to do rescue work with dogs to find them 
new homes.  I worked with 2 large organizations 
and then quit.  I had 3 emergency calls to help 
German Shepherd Dogs.  They are still here with 
me and I am still looking to place them.  I am 
willing to donate these babies to work for 
someone, somehow, you know?  I can't even begin 
to imagine why it costs $6,000.00 to get a dog 
from a pound and train it.  Who is getting all 
this money?  I wouldn't do that to a person who 
needs help, even if they were rich!  I just 
wouldn't donate them to go off to war.  They are 
all socialable and pleasant.

But if you could guide me to the right place to 
help me attain this $600.00 for this course, I 
don't need to be affiliated with them, just the 
Guide Dog Foundation.

Thank you for all of your precious time.

is insured through NC health Choice. I know that 
because of income he will lose this coverage in 
Sept. I have tried to find insurance for him and 
it is proven to be unattainable because of cost. 
What options do I have? I actually feel sick to 
my stomach thinking I cannot afford to care for 
his needs.

Hello Sir or Madam,
Is there any information out on long term care insurance for people with diabetes?  I am a CDE as well as a person living with diabetes.  My patients have started to ask and I am curious myself but have not found much on the internet.

I have had diabetes since I was 13.  I am now 
38.  I am appealing a denial of SSI benefits.  
SSI told me I made too much money in a one year 
period in 1995.  Are you aware of particular 
arguments to support an award of SSI benefits for 
diabetics who are not able to work full time?  Is 
there someone I should speak to at ADA?  Thank 
you.

I was wondering about if anything prohibits me 
from becoming a state trooper in massachusetts.  
I am healthy, have had diabetes for 24 years and 
have been on the Insulin Pump for 6 years.  I 
did have three diabetic related seizures in 1989 
to 1991.  Would this disqualify me?  I haven't 
had one since that time, even throughout my 
pregnancy my diabetes was under control.  My A1C 
ranges from 6%-7% at all times.  Please let me 
know.  I have gotten mixed messages and I don't 
want to get my hopes up if there is no chance 
that I would get on the force.

Hello.
This is Jason Paskowitz.  I am a Type II 
diabetic.  I am also married to a Type I, 
insulin-dependent diabetic.  Today I received a 
solicitation for a donation from the American 
Diabetes Association. Please note that until the 
ADA changes its position in regard to receiving 
donations from SLM Corporation (aka &quot;Sallie 
Mae&quot;), we will not support the ADA in any way.  
Please do not send us any further solicitations 
or issues of &quot;Diabetes Forecast.&quot;
 
The loansharks at Sallie Mae have done more to 
destroy our lives than diabetes has.  Sallie Mae 
is the reason that we have a solid middle-class 
income but are unable to purchase a home.  My 
student loans from the 1980's, totalling $16k in 
principal, went into default about FIFTEEN YEARS 
AGO due to the failed economy of George H.W. 
Bush and, admittedly, some early-twenties career 
indirection on my part.  The balance has now 
ballooned to over $50k including over $10,000 
in &quot;collection fees and costs.&quot;  These fess and 
costs are assessed by the numerous do-nothing 
collection/beggar agencies owned by Sallie Mae 
(a for-profit corporation traded on the stock 
market).  
 
One of these collection/beggar agencies is 
Pioneer Credit Recovery in Arcade, NY, which has 
made direct donations to the local ADA.  Much 
was made about their donations to the ADA and 
other charitable organizations.  In fact, I 
think it's a shame that former Governor George 
Pataki and Congressman Tom Reynolds are unable 
to create any sort of REAL jobs in economically-
depressed upstate New York and are actually 
enthusiastic about having a collection agency as 
the Arcade-area's largest employer.
 
Additionally, you should know that Albert L. 
Lord, Chairman of SLM Corp (Sallie Mae's formal 
corporate name), has taken home over $250 
MILLION in compensation since 1999.  He has his 
own private golf course, where he and his wife, 
Suzanne, entertain members of Congress like 
Reynolds and the perpetually-tanned, former 
House Majority Leader John Boehner.  Boehner's 
daughter, Tricia, conveniently enough works for 
General Revenue Corporation, another star in the 
Sallie Mae galaxy of collection/beggar 
agencies.  Not content to make a quarter billion 
dollars off of middle class college students and 
their families, Mr. Lord recently engaged in a 
vulgar display of his wealth by trying to 
purchase the Washington Nationals Major League 
Baseball team.
 
If the American Diabetes Association wants to 
take money from SLM Corporation, then feel free 
to do so.  In the interim, don't expect any 
support from the two diabetics in our home.

Hi,

I am Type 2 with no insurance and only qualify for the state high risk pool; Kansas.  To qualify for the high risk pool you have to be turned down by 2  carriers, which I was.  But this brought a question to my mind; im sure those carriers which turned me down cover other diabetics under certain group plans.  This seems like discrimination, a diabetic is a diabetic, but im sure they have some way around this.  Any information to explain this would be helpful

I am a full-time federal government employee, and 
a collateral duty wildland firefighter for the 
last 6 years. I have had type I diabetes for 26 
years and have not has any issues fighting fire 
with my diabetes. Each year, I have a note from 
my Dr. that I have her clearance to perform the 
arduous duties of a wildland fire-fighter.  This 
year, the Interagency medical standards manager 
determined that I shouldn't be given clearance to 
perform arduous duties.  When I talked to him he 
stated that my hypoglycemic episodes concerned 
him and my HbA1c was on the high end of normal, 
which made them think I wasn't in good enough 
control, even though my own endocrinologist gave 
me her consent. I know this isn't much 
information, but I am really frustrated and 
feeling like I am being singled out and the the 
people making the decision are un-imformed or ill-
informed. To make a new decision, they want a 
years worth of my HbA1c tests and 3 months of my 
daily monitoring, which they didn't ask for back 
in February when my Dr signed her letter of 
censent. After all this, the soonest they will 
make a new determination will be in 
October...after the fire season. HELP...?

I have searched all over the web site and even 
phoned ADA, but I can't for the life of me 
understand why the organization does not have any 
kind of advocacy around the cost of insulin. 

This is a vital drug that many, many diabetics 
depend on, yet there is no generic for it, no 
discount and it is not fully covered by any kind 
of Medicare. 

My mother is a Type 2 diabetic, and despite very 
good health insurance, typically uses up any 
allowance for prescriptions by May or June of the 
year. She is going broke just trying to stay 
alive. 

Of course, it's not just my mother who has this 
problem. There must be thousands and thousands of 
seniors facing similar difficulties. Yet ADA is 
silent. Why?

Dear ADA, 

I am writing on behalf of the AHRQ Effective 
Health Care Program to see about the possibility
possibility of the American Diabetes Association 
participating with us in new research by 
nominating diabetes advocacy experts to help us 
develop key questions. Please forward this email 
along to all of your colleagues who might have 
an interest in our work.  If you could also name 
some appropriate contacts for us at the ADA, 
that would be great.

Currently, we are forming a technical expert 
group to look at diabetes in order to come up 
with key questions that will form the basis of a 
systematic review of evidence-based medicine. We 
would like the American Diabetes Association
to participate in this process by making some 
appropriate nominations. For this topic we are 
hoping to find nominations of both organization 
and patient advocates.  It will likely take the 
participant 10 to 15 hours of their time over 
the course of a year, along with some email 
correspondence. 

Thanks so much for your help. Feel free to give 
me a call or send me an email if you have 
questions. You can also get more information on 
the program by going to our web site, 
http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov.

Warm regards,
Shannon Smith

Are there any kind of medical alert cards that 
can be carried when traveling to inform airline 
security personnel that you have an insulin 
pump?  I was recently traveling when my pump set 
off the metal detectors.  I told them that I was 
wearing an insulin pump and even took it off to 
show them.  The screener said that she had never 
seen one before and therefore she had to wand me 
and do a complete pat down.  I was so humiliated 
and felt pretty violated afterwards, having some 
strange person touch my entire body in front of 
a ton of onlookers.  I even ended up crying 
afterwards.  I was told that people with 
pacemakers carry a card to warn the TSA of their

humiliating pat down every time I fly...I'm 
never flying again.  It just wasn't worth it.

How does one fight discrimination when the 
apartment manager is a minority? There is an 
ongoing problem with minority favoritism with 2 
sets of rules. I am an excellent tenant, get 
along well with my neighbors, pay my rent on 
time, keep my apartment clean and I desperately 
need some help. I am in the process of 
purchasing a major business in town and 
sincerely do not need this harrassment. The 
folks in this apartment complex are hesitant to 
speak up for themselves, fearing reprisal. 
Example of how ridiculous this is: I am 100% 
disabled and it is difficult in the heat for me 
to carry garbage out every day. Two small bags, 
neatly tied and placed in an open container to 
avoid odor. I have been told I will be evicted 
(in writing two days in a row)  for doing this. 
Neighbors doing the same things are not being 
instructed in the same manner. I do believe this 
is reverse discrimination and I did have 
pictures taken and I am contacting the corporate 
office. Is there anything else that I can do to 
help myself and my neighbors? Respectfully,

I am a RVN era veteran and was woundering if any
research or actions have been taken in being
exposed to Agent Orange here in the United States
or by other soldiers from their clothes? They used
Agent Orange at Fort Benning, Ga and I have been
exposed by other soldiers  having it on their
clothes. I have seen fellow soldiers shake out
their clothes and asked what it was and they would
say &quot; oh that is Agent Orange. Hard to get it out
of uniforms&quot; or something similar. The reason I
ask this now is because I have been diagnosed with
type 2 and have no family history of diabetes.
When I am at the Veterans Hospital I and others
have noticed there is a very large percentage of
secondhand exposure and the numbers of diabetic
veterans is larger than the general public. Your
help is greatly appreciated.

I have been employed with my employer for 27 
years and have worked either 7-3pm, 3-11pm or 11-
7am. For approximately the past five years I have 
elected to work a 11-7am shift. My shift was 
changed from 11-7am effective june26,2006. I am 
now required to work from 3am -11:30am. I am in a 
supervisory position. I requested to be allowed 
to transfer to a location that still has a 11-7am 
shift and was told that No bumping rights(being 
able to bump someone with less senority) would be 
honored. I explained that because of my illness 
it would create a hardship on me. In addition to 
being a diabetic I have been under doctor's care 
for a foot injury that has lasted over a year. I 
wear a brace support on my foot and suffer from 
tendonitis. I have amedical record of being 
treated for severe depression as well.
I was informed that no doctor would say that I 
have to work a certain shift and that no 
accomodations would be made.

In addition to this my wages were docked because 
I supposidly forgot to punch the time clock when 
leaving work oneday. I was informed that I had to 
wait until the next pay period to get paid.

I suffered a skin irration on my foot and was 
seen in the emergency room, I take darvocet N-100 
for pain and had no intentions of not reporting 
to work but the medication caused drowiness and I 
fell asleep. I notified my supervisor the 
following morning and provided the emergency room 
slip and explained what happened but I was marked 
awol for not notifying someone in advance that I 
was not coming in. I have been refused pay for 
this date even with medical documentation.(on 
this date the two employees that I supervise 
called off work and there is an extremely long 
gate protecting the facility that I am not able 
to open which numerous peocomplained about and 
the employer refuses to do anything about it, had 
I gone to work I could not gain access to the 
premises without assistance to open this gate 
anyway)

What relief can I get in these situations?

She eats right and gives herself her injections. 
She works 2 jobs. How can she get this pump paid

I was in a hospital and they were filling me with 
an IV loaded with dextrose and every time they

asked about a diabetic diet as they sent me grape

When I asked about the diet they told me they did 
not have a diabetic diet in the hospital.  Is

I need help for my son who is now 31 yrs old and not taking care of his diabetes.  He gave up his pump, lost health insurance, just got back to work but no health benefits.  He is type 1 diabetic and has been since 19.  He recently suffered through a traumatic divorce and left the PA area to live in Ft.Lauderdale with his sister, who is a great support.  She has been trying to help him access the welfare dept there for healthcare only until he can get health insurance through a job.  he had been going to a doctor, but now has none and will be running out of insulin soon.  We don't know what to do.  Can you help us to either locate a free clinic for him to see a doctor and receive lantus insuling and his humalog(or maybe it's novalog, i can't be sure)?
Please advise me if you can to find someone from that locale to help us.  Are there any particular hints as we try to help him get health care through welfare in Florida?

I am student of Professor Michael Dukakis and we 
are working on our class papers regarding a 
health care memo to Senator Kennedy. The topic 
of my memorandum is adult obesity prevention. I 
am suggesting that Senator Kennedy propose 
legislation similar to S.799 (his bill to amend 
the Public Health Service Act). I am suggesting 
that Kennedy provide for the coordination of 
Federal Government policies and activities to 
prevent adult obesity.

I was wondering if you had answers and/or 
information to the following questions:

1) Are you aware of whether the American 
Diabetes Association is working with any federal 
congressmen on anything regarding adult obesity 
(which can lead to Type 2 diabetes)?

2) Do you have any specific legislation that 
your organization would like to put forth 
regarding adult obesity prevention?

Thank you so much for your help. If you have any 
other information on adult obesity prevention 
efforts at the government level, I'd really 
appreciate it.

Dear Sir or Madame:

I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in January 
1986, at the age of 6.  I have not allowed my 
diabetes to hold me back, especially in my adult 
life: I am an insulin-pump-wearing runner who has 
worked on Capitol Hill for two House members (one 
of whom is in a leadership position) and clerked 
for a federal judge after finishing law school 
with honors.

I write to remind you that there are two sides to 
the stem cell debate.  In particular, I am deeply 
disappointed about the ADA Advocacy web page's 
politically charged statement regarding President 
Bush and his veto of H.R. 810.  The web page 
fails to mention that the legislation in question 
(H.R. 810) does not FORBID stem cell research, 
but merely limits federal funding for such 
research.  In addition, by characterizing the 
failure of H.R. 810 as a &quot;devastating setback&quot; 
for all persons with diabetes, the web page 
connotes that the particular type of stem cell 
research that was the subject of H.R. 810 is the 
ONLY type of stem cell research available.  In 
fact, many commentators have opined that adult 
stem cell research could be more promising than 
the type of stem cell research that was the 
subject of H.R. 810.  Finally, the web page 
assumes that all citizens with diabetes support 
stem cell research when the stem cells are from 
unborn embryos; perhaps the ADA Advocacy team 
would be surprised to find that I am one of many 
Americans with Type 1 diabetes who sees stem cell 
research as not the most promising of the current 
cure endeavors, and that stem cell research, 
which undoubtedly involves the destruction of 
life, is a due process violation, under the 
Constitution's 5th and 14th amendments. 
 
Moreover, the ADA Advocacy web page regarding 
H.R. 810 appears to lament about our country's 
legislative structure and basic principles 
regarding the separation of powers.  I find it 
unprofessional and inexpert that the web page 
blames President Bush alone for the failure of 
H.R. 810.  Perhaps the ADA Advocacy team should 
remember that the executive and legislative 
branches maintain an important relationship with 
regard to the enactment of legislation.  That is, 
the legislature must pass a single bill in both 
houses by a simple majority of each house's 
quorum; subsequently, the President then has the 
opportunity to sign or veto the proposed 
legislation.  The bill may then return to both 
houses of Congress, which have yet ANOTHER 
opportunity to pass the legislation by overriding 
the President's veto via a supermajority of each 
house's quorum.  Therefore, the ultimate decision 
lies in the hands of the Senate and House, not 
the President.  These checks and balances are 
critical to our legislative structure, as they 
are designed to overcome potentially 
unforeseeable political motivations.  As such, if 
H.R. 810 were so promising and would OBVIOUSLY 
have led to a cure for so many diseases, 
including diabetes, I would fully expect that the 
sponsors of H.R. 810 would have been able to 
overcome the President's veto by securing a two-
thirds majority in each house.  As you know, they 
were not able to do this. 

Overall, this issue regarding stem cell research 
is extremely controversial, and rightly so.  I 
encourage the ADA Advocacy team to remember that 
not all persons with diabetes agree with regard 
to this issue.  Statements such as the one on the 
ADA Advocacy web page regarding H.R. 810 
(e.g., &quot;It is sad to know that President Bush 
took that hope away from all of us&quot;) will merely 
isolate those who may disagree with the ADA, or 
who may not yet maintain a viewpoint, on this 
sensitive issue.  The ADA has already organized 
its supporters for this legislation; therefore, I 
fail to see the value in posting controversial 
statements on the ADA Advocacy web page after the 
legislation has failed.  Such statements, at 
best, are of de minimus value.

Given the ADA's web page synopsis of H.R. 810, I 
will now, unfortunately, hesitate to participate 
in ADA fundraisers such as the annual Walk for 
Diabetes.  I encourage the ADA to remove the 
aforementioned controversial statements from the 
ADA Advocacy web page, and refocus its efforts on 
FORTHCOMING legislative possibilities and 
endeavors.

Sincerely,
Katie Inman

now. I called the pharmacy 4 hours later and they 
said that the until I am to be seen in the office

My ex-husband was recently diagnosed with 
Diabetes and has no health plan. He was admitted 
to the hospital and after 1 week he was released. 
The reason he was admitted was his sugar level 
was around 500. Since his diabetes was out of 
control they admitted him to find that he had 
several boils all over his body from an infection 
that was resting just above his heart. After 
extensive amounts of antibiotics and insulin they 
released him for home care. It has been 4 weeks 
since he was released. He has lost around 40 
pounds and all of his muscle mass is gone, he has 
no feeling in his left foot, is in constant pain 
to the point where he can barely walk and will 
shake and cry from the pain. One week ago he went 
back to the emergency room again becasue the pain 
was so bad. They gave him a perscription for pain 
killers and released him. He is no better off 
today. My childern are 18 and 20 years old and 
are trying to care for their father. I do not 
know where to go or what to do to make this 
better for him and our children. He does not have 
a primary care physision and since he has been 
out of work for so long his finances are limited. 
The state did pick up the tab for his insulin and 
antibiotics but I am not happy with the health 
care he has been given. Where can I go and who 
can I talk to for advice? I would appreciate any 
information you can give me.

I thought the following would be most appropriately directed to the Advocacy and Donation aspects of the ADA, because this seems most relevant to those missions. 



I am writing to express my disappointment in statements made by the Chief Medical and Scientific Officer of the American Diabetes Association at a recent conference on diabetes and technology.  Because of these comments, I will no longer contribute financially to the ADA, and I will encourage those I know to switch their support to other diabetes associations.  

Specifically, I am disappointed in Dr. Richard Kahn's disparagement of insulin pump technology and intensive glucose monitoring.  Ignoring the real and  profound benefits of tight glycemic control, as evidenced by the DCCC and UKPDS trials, Dr. Kahn stated that there is no evidence that more frequent blood glucose monitoring can improve the health and quality of life of diabetic patients  and expressed his concern about spending &quot;taxpayer money&quot; on more frequent testing.  I did not realize that the ADA had changed its focus from being an advocate for the lives and health of diabetic patients to being a tax watchdog.  Dr. Kahn also dismissed the idea that insulin pumps can improve glycemic control and quality of life.  

I am an insulin dependent, type I diabetic patient. I have had diabetes since June 1985, when I was five years old.  I am not a scientist, so I cannot speak to Dr. Kahn's scientific points, though I would encourage him to re-examine the trials mentioned above and their findings on how glycemic control can reduce the complications of this illness.

When I was a teenager, I took my blood sugar Dr. Kahn's recommended 3 times per day.  Testing 3 times a day would, on average, allow a person to test every 5 ? hours.  Blood sugar can change quite rapidly  sometimes in as little as 20 minutes.   Insulin dosage is something that many patients need to adjust throughout their lives.  In order to appropriately change insulin dosages to respond to patient needs, patients and doctors need information about the body's reaction to food, exercise and other factors.  3 tests per day cannot provide that kind of information.

When I tested 3 times per day, my HbA1C was quite high  once as high as 14.  In his capacity as a taxpayer advocate, Dr. Kahn may be unaware of the import of that number, but the ADA's own website should inform him that this number indicates a severe lack of glycemic control likely to result in complications such as blindness, nerve and circulatory damage, kidney damage, cardiac complications, or coma.   

I now test 6-10 times per day.  My HbA1C has ranged in the past year from 5.4-6.0. 

I use my test results to appropriately adjust my insulin to the types of foods I eat, the time of day, and my activity level, among other things.  Testing before and after I eat gives me valuable information about food absorption.  Testing before and after exercise gives me information about how my body responds to exercise  and, when exercising differently from usual, can prevent severe low blood sugar reactions.   Testing when I wake up gives me information about my nighttime blood sugars and helps me control those better.  Testing before bed is essential to ward off nighttime lows that could endanger my life. I would be very interested to know which 3-7 tests Dr. Kahn thinks it unnecessary for me to do and what information he thinks I should stop responding to.  

In taking a look at my recent blood sugar logs for the past week, I see that on average I tested 7 times a day.  On average, 5 of those times required a response  an adjustment to my insulin, consumption of food, or a reduction in my basal rate.  Dr. Kahn apparently would prefer that I allowed myself to get low or high at those times because there is no evidence that justifies my having that information. 

If Dr. Kahn truly believes that diabetics need to limit themselves to 3 tests a day, the ADA must revise its HbA1C guidelines in contravention of medical evidence. 

I take insulin through a pump.  While I concede that a pump may not produce significant improvement in patients who are not motivated to test their blood sugar frequently (which is presumably why Dr. Kahn dismisses the pump  he believes no one should test their blood sugar frequently), it has produced stunning results in my case, dropping my HbA1C from 7.1  slightly over the ADA's own recommended level  to the range I mentioned above  well below it.   

But more than the numbers show, I am a healthier and happier person.  Achieving 7.1 without the pump took 10 tests per day, shots before and after meals, and never sleeping through the night so I could take a shot to cover my 3am blood sugar rise.  I also experienced frequent and dangerous low blood sugars because I could not control my insulin rates finely enough with multiple daily injections for the type of control I desired to achieve.  My blood sugars dropped below 30 several times during this period.  

Now I can sleep through the night.  I rarely experience a low blood sugar.  I can go to the gym when I have time and energy, rather than when my disease mandates.  And when I want to share a slice of pizza with my husband, my decision is whether I want olives or green peppers on it  not whether it's worth testing 2 and 3 hours after I eat and taking one or two shots to cover the slower absorption.   I am not a religious person, so I do not thank God for my insulin pump.  But I do thank the scientists, researchers and clinical trial participants who made it possible.  I thank my insurance company.  The pump has not only protected my life and health, it has improved the quality of both of those things. 

I hope that my experience is illustrative of the diabetic community's strong disapproval of Dr. Kahn's comments.  I hope that the ADA will consider its mission and goal and whether such comments are truly in keeping with it.  And I hope that one day I will be able to support the ADA again.

Sincerely,


Mary Nir

I have a question regarding my 23 year old son.  
He is unable to find permanent employment with 
health care.  He is uninsured and on an insulin 
pump.  He currently works as a temp for $8.  He 
recently took an employment physical for a new 
job at $10 w/ ben., but an Occupational Health 
Clinic Dr. &quot;passed&quot; him with restrictions of no 
lifting or climbing (after seeing him 10 minutes) 
and told him he was a Brittle Diabetic, even 
though he is in good health and his last H1C was 
8.0.  He's never had an issue in any other job of 
the same type.  We need advice on how to get a 
job without his Diabetes becoming an issue.  
Thank you!

I am an RN CDE assisting a Medicare Patient with 
limited income in his diabetes management.  He 
has severe hypoglycemia unawareness which has 
resulted in multiple trips to the ER, seizure 
activity, and even some mental/cognitive 
changes.  I wrote Medicare in attempt to gain 
him coverage for the DexCom CGMS device which 
has been a life-saver in that it alerts him to 
rapidly dropping blood sugar.  He has 
been &quot;borrowing&quot; our office CGMS due to unable 
to afford his own.  Anyway, I have not heard 
back from Medicare and I am wondering if there 
are other options to consider.  I'm not sure if 
it is out of my bounds as an RN CDE to contact 
government officials on this patient's behalf.  
Any advice is welcome!

We are looking at a 504 for my son who is a 
sophmore in high school.
We want his teachers each year to know of his 
disease and what to do in case he needs help.
We requested a meeting with the school counselor 
and whomever would be involved in this process.

Unfortunately there was a death in the family 
and I had to leave town the day before the 
scheduled meeting.
I learned later that the meeting happened any 
way and my son was told that they( the staff, 
principal, counselor and district psychologist) 
had decided that he would be fine without the 
504 if he would just take care of his disease 
there should not be any problem ( his 
endocronologist feels he is doing fine).
It appeared to me that they had decided if my 
son took care of his disease he would not need a 
504. 
This was not the intent of our requesting the 
504. It is his right and I wanted to also make 
sure this was in his records going off to 
college whereby we may be able to have some 
advocacy when away at college, if necessary.

I want to know beside reminding the school of my 
son's right to a 504 where do i look for further 
advocacy?
We were also told to look at Advocacy 88? I am 
afraid i did not understand this.

If you can point us in the right direction I 
would appreciate the help.

My parents take her to school &amp; then I pick her up, which has been working for over a year now. but with the new schedule my parents would have to take her to school &amp; then pick her up. My parents are several doctors that they see on regular bases which they might be able to pick her up.

Hi,

I'd like to inform you on a recent problem here 
in Pennsylvania... 

Over one year ago the Access Card for all on 
Medicaid decided to deny Humalog insulin and 
recently has denied Novolog. Thus there is no 
short acting insulin available to type 1 
diabetics on Medicaid without a prior 
authorization.. To get a prior authorization is 
very time consuming and a person does not always 
get it... There is a BIG problem here....

Yes, I am actually emailing for a friend. His 
name is Brian Jordan and he is a 27 diabetic and 
his been a insulin dependant juveinile diabetic 
since he was 7. He was dropped from Tenncare 
when they did all the dropping, he has diabetic 
neuropathy and his eyesight is very poor. He is 
on an insulin pump, but unfotunately he is down 
to his last maybe month of supplies. He became 
unemployied about 2 months ago and went to sign 
up for Tenncare again and they told him NO. He 
has got over 12,000 just this month in Doctor 
bills and I can not find him help anywhere. Can 
you please help me? The last thing in the world 
that I want to do is to lose my best friend! 
Please any suggestions, his gluagon kit is over 
$100. He only gets $160 a week from unemployment.

Seriously scared,
Patrice Chisolm

Could you tell me what being a Diabetes Advocate
means?  I just raised some money for the ADA in
the Nov. 4 walk in DC, and I'm very excited about
getting more involved in Advocacy.  I talked to an
ADA rep for Advocacy there at the walk, so I think
that's how I got on her email list, and I just got
an email inviting me to invite my friends and
family to &quot;become Diabetes Advocates.&quot;  I have
over 130 close friends and family that I will ask
to join when I send out my Christmas cards, but I
need to know details about what it involves.  When
a person becomes a Diabetes Advocate, do they make
a monitary donation?  Does their name go on a list
of people  that simply support pro-diabetes
legislation in spirit?  Do they get emails and/or
paper mailings?  I can do a lot to support this
effort, but I need to know what I'm asking my
family and friends to do.
Many thanks, 
Lara Coutinho

I am really angry. My husband lost his job a 
couple month ago and his cobra insurance is 
suspended. I have been turned down for short 
term health insurance because of a preexist 
condition of insulin resistance. My own doctors 
feel that I am not diabetic and refuse to 
provide me access to diabetic health education 
and meters while I was insured. Now that I am 
uninisured I am being denied insurance. Which 
way is it? Am I a diabetic or not. And if I am 
not why can't I get insurance. 
Thank you,

I work for the federal government and have filed 
an eeo against my agency the faa for 
discrimination of my diabetices.  I feel as if I 
need some legal questions answered as they are 
now after filing the eeo several months ago and 
going formal are comfronting me with dot order 
1101.1 and us dot order 1400.12.  This seems a 
little late in my book when they denied my 
request for some reasonable accomondations for 
my insulin and supplies and actually made it 
harder for me to have access.  Can you suggest 
anything for me.  Thanks, Jo Ann

PS This is my second eeo against the agency for 
the same thing.  Diabetices, first trying to 
keep me out of the technical field and now 
making it hard for me to access my meds, since 
my dosages have increased.

Dear Sir or Mafdam.
I am the Owner of a time-share-rent for a flat 
in a 5 Star hotel facility on Gran Canaria.
A buyer got in contact with me to buy my shares 
for the American Diabetes Association. He told 
me, that ADA is planning to build a new Congress 
Center because of the salubrious climate on Gran 
Canaria.
The Offer was signed by John Richard Moore.
I want to make sure now if you heard of the 
plans from ADA, or could it be, that they want 
to cheat me.
Please answer as quick as possible.
Yours sincerly

A friend of mine's ex-wife is fighting for full 
custody of their two boys...and her basis is the 
fact that he has type1 diabetes (since 10years 
old)..he is now 38 years old..and an amazing 
father!..the Friend of the Court &quot;mediator&quot; has 
asked for his diabetic history and his &quot;current 
status&quot;..a note from his physician has been 
requested.  Is this legal?..is this 
discrimination due to his disability?..he has an 
attorney..but she is not back in her office 
until Monday..and he is very distraught..Any 
suggestions?..thank you, Stacy Acker RN

I have a question...I hope I'm asking it in the 
right place.  I am a former nursing student.  I 
was recently asked to leave my nursing program, 
against my wishes.  They said that my testing my 
blood sugar in public (in front of students and 
professors) and having my insulin pump tubing 
showing is &quot;attention seeking behaviors&quot;.  Can 
they say this to me?  Do I have any rights 
against this kind of statement/treatment?  

Thanks for your advice,
Jenny Sandy

Dear friends! I don't have any problems with the 
Web site, but I do have a question about my 
legal rights. If you cannot answer the question, 
please, forward my e-mail to someone who can 
help me with an advice. I am 55 with diabetes, 
unemployed. It is very difficult to find a job. 
Once I had a job and hide the fact that I am a 
diabetic, and later was in trouble. Now, if I 
tell to the employer that I am a diabetic, 
nobody would hire me dispite the fact that I can 
do any job even better than a non-diabetic. As 
time goes by, it seems that my husband wants a 
life without me. He cryes at me without any 
reasons and every time I ask for money for 
medicines, he cries that I have to go to job. 
What happens that my situation becomes worse. 
When I was working, I did a very good job and 
felt very good.The problem was that during the 
breaks I did not sit with the team, but had to 
hide to take blood tests. They became suspicious 
and I went through troubles. I want to know what 
are my legal rights. I think that I can order a 
protectional order from the court that he stop 
crying  and I can file for a separate 
maintenance. Or, maybe, you know were I can run 
away? I would like to run away as soon as 
possible,but would it be a right choice? And the 
worse, because he wants to start a new life, he 
does not want to support me, he spreads lies 
about me, about our past life. I don't know how 
to stop this, to go to the court? Any legal 
advice will be appreciated.
Thank you in advance
Please e-mail me an answer: marinabron@yahoo.com

I just have questions of where to go for some 
medical assistance. I dont know if I have reached 
the right organization. I am 37 years old and 
have been insulin dependant diabetic for 30 
years. I have no insurance and am pregnant. At 
this piont my husband and I are deed broke with 
the medical bills growing quickly. So far the 
baby is 100% fine. I am wondering where to go for 
prescription assistance and other help for our 
rising medical bills. Please guide me in the 
right direction thank you Alex

As a Type I diabetic of 16 years and a physician 
assistant, I am quite frustrated at the lack of 
national awareness towards diabetes.  I have 
made it my personal mission to increase this 
level of awareness to the level the breast 
cancer awareness groups have done.  I am 
confused by the multiple colors and ribbons that 
signify diabetes.  Blue bracelets, grey ribbons, 
red advocacy shirts/merchandise.  I believe we 
need to first unify these discrepencies so we 
can move forward with a powerful awareness 
campaign.  I would appreciate a response on how 
to complete this and why the multiple colors for 
diabetes.  Thank you for your time.

I am a 52 year old , white female  Type 1 
diabetic. I teach special education and have 
taught for 20 years. This year I have had to take 
a 12 week family medical leave act, due to my 
doctor having to regulate 2 kinds of insulin on 
me. Our assistant Principal has given me a 
punitive duty schedule from 7:00 AM until the 
last child is called for in the PM could be 5:00 
or 6:00 PM, no other teacher has to be at school 
until 7:20 or 7:30 AM  and are allowed to leave 
at 3:05PM..She has discriminated against me I do 
not know why....I go back to work in about 4 
weeks from my leave ,how do I approach this 
situation? Or, should I retire and draw 
significantly less  than I now make? Please 
advise me as soon as possible. Thank you , Debbie

What is the standard waiting period to see if 
blood glucose levels are stable.  I had 2 
episodes in May 06 of low blood sugar and 1 in 
Aug., the company doctor has me on 6 months of 
resricted duty.  I can not do my job as an 
electrician or drive any vechiles in the plant, 
however I can drive approximately 70 miles round 
trip each day to get here.  Since the middle of 
Aug. my blood sugars have been excellent.  I have 
gone on the insulin pump and they are great.

I am a second year med student at Cornell 
Medical School.  This last summer I was in 
Guatemala, and while there, I observed in a 
government run diabetes clinic.  This sparked my 
interest in diabetes care, and I want to put 
together some sort of event for world diabetes 
day on November 14 at Cornell.  Since this 
year's theme is 'Diabetes Care for Everyone', I 
want to focus on the diabetes epidemic in new 
york city; perhaps along the lines of the new 
york times article series last year.  I was 
wondering if the advocacy division of the ADA 
knew of someone in NYC who could speak on the 
diabetes epidemic from an activist or political 
perspective.  I would also like to combine the 
lecture with some sort of political action 
(letter writing, lobbying) so that it would be 
more than just a talk.  Thank you in advance for 
any thoughts you may have on this proposed event.

Best,

Ian

My mom has diabetes and my dad died recently. 
The question I have is, is there anywhere that 
will help her with bills medical and otherwise 
the insurance companies aren't wanting to pay 
for anything since he died and she can't even go 
to the doctor because of it. Also her roof is 
leaking and there are a few other problems that 
she needs help with. I live in Ohio she lives in 
Indiana I help out all I can but I just don't 
know much about dealing with insurance companies 
or how to get her help with anything. Any 
information you could give would be VERY Greatly 
appreciated.  Thank You for your time

Hello:

I am diabetic, since the age of 1 1/2 years old 
and am now 27.  I have attendended concerts in 
the meantime, one of which I didn't know would 
ever come true...seeing U2 live.  

A question I did have was, do you ever depending 
on state to state, have a person be the face of 
the ADA?  Especially someone with a story such 
as mine?  Mine was the youngest any one has ever 
heard of and I am thinking if many young people 
hear about it, they might think that there is 
more they can do in life and not just site and 
be bored. I mean with so many cases being in the 
world and people not knowing, it might be good 
for a face of youth to be part of the ADA and I 
was going to be a part of it back in Colorado 
but had to move at the time.  Right now this is 
not the case, and I would love to help with 
this.  Maybe more people would see that they can 
live with it.

Just a thought....

Thanks for your time.

Jess
P.S.  I'm a part of the ONE Campaign, DATA, 
Product (RED), etc. and I love doing community 
work so that's why I don't mind letting people 
know there is more to life than just sitting in 
a room watching tv.!  :)

Is the association doing anything to reintroduce 
animal based insulins for the millions of 
diabetics who can't use human based insulin? My 
boyfriend has had many cases of a sudden drop in 
blood sugar, with no symptoms of hypocglycemia. 
He is currently importing insulin from the UK 
and although it is very expensive, he has not 
been to the emergency room in quite some time. 

Thanks, 

Rebecca

How should I proceed in helping to get funded 
programs for insurance coverage for the many 
diabetics out there with no insurance?  Many are 
between the ages of 19 and 64, and most have no 
insurance due to the high monthly premium 
rates.  I do know that some states currently 
have funded programs that these high risk 
uninsured people, (not just with diabetes, but 
other long term diseases as well) are able to 
possibly get insurance through at a much lower 
cost per month to help with the doctor bills and 
prescriptions.  We all know that if a long term 
disease such as diabetes is well managed, there 
are much fewer complications later in life for a 
diabetic due to the high quality of care they 
received as early as possible upon being 
diagnosed with the disease.

Please send me information as to who to talk to 
so that we can start taking care of the 
insurance problems for long term disease care.

Thank you!

Sincerely,
Sandie Hoke

I am looking for more information in regards to my
child entering the public school system and what
his legal rights are in the State of Pennsylvania
for type 1 diabetes care and management. I can
find plenty of information on his federal rights,
but no specific information on the state laws, or
the laws in the Sate College School System
(www.scasc.org). I want to make sure the school is
required to administer insulin when needed and
wether or not a full time nurse or classroom aide
is required if I request it. There will also be 3
other type 1 diabetic children entering the same
school,and in the same grade he will be entering
if that makes a difference. Thank you.

I need help. I am a Viet-Nam era Diabled vet 
with type II diabetes and am being discriminated 
against due to my disability. I am a Postal 
supervisor in Ft.Lauderdale,Fl. and am being 
told that there is no work avilable for me due 
to limitations from my disability. The Postal 
Service will not respond to me in writing as 
they are obligated to as per the Rehabilitation 
Act and the Reasonable Accommodations Act. Do I 
have to pursue this through litigation or can I 
recieve some form of intervention from the 
American Diabetes Association. Ihave 30 years of 
Federal Service and am being forced to use all 
of my personal leave and sick leave in hope that 
I would feel a financial crunch and apply for 
disability retirement. Ihave been out of work 
since 07/31/06. I find this kind of ironic being 
that my plant manager tells me to give him a 
week or so on 10/13/06 being that October was 
National Americans With Disabilities month and 
November being National Diabetes month as well 
as Veterans Day! I would appreciate any 
assistance or intervention. Callme @ (904) 233-
7114.

Thank you.

Hello.  My name is Lorena and I have a 5 year old daughter who is Type 1.  My family recently attended the JDRF diabetes Expo in Rye, NY and learned more about the cost of insulin pumps. I  was shocked and worried. We have a DME cap of $1250.00.  Half of that has been used toward strips, syringes, etc.  I am not asking for handouts, but a little help. We might qualify for state programs once we exhaust the cap,but there is no guarantee.  Thank you for your time..

I represent a diabetic truck driver (Mr. Jeffrey 
Mather) who was fired immediately upon his 
employer learning that he has diabetes.  Since 
being terminated, he has received a federal 
exemption from the DOT which permits him to 
drive interstate trucks again, and he is already 
back on the road with another comopany as an 
interstate, commercial truck driver. I have just 
received his right-to-sue notice from EEOC and I 
will soon file complaint in US District Court 
for Southern Maryland. Accoridngly, I read an 
article about the assitance the ADA provided to 
attorney John Griffin, and I wanted to inquire 
as to whether or not the ADA would consider 
acting in an amicus curiae capacity in the suit.

Practitioners and Providers in the Austin area 
are interested in developing a local coalition 
initiated by the Seton Network. My school 
district is within this group. I have 
volunteered to look at diabetes coalition 
frameworks to make sure that we start in 
allignment with the greater organizations 
supporting diabetes, and that we do not compete 
with previously existing organizations or 
coalitions in the Austin area. I would 
appreciate anything that you may have to offer. 
Thank you!

her dad,because I have to leave work and go check 
her sugar level every day at 10am and 1 pm while 
she's at school( Providence St. Mel),I was 
wondering if there was someone I could write to 
to see what i can do about getting a nurse,or 
some competent person to visit her schoolto 
assist these students with diabetes,because if 
she needs insuline she can't draw it up and 
inject herself,but until then I will continue to 
do it myself.i spoke to the principle,she said 
they never had a school nurse that the other 
students check there own level themselves,but 
what if they need to have insuline,that is my 
concern,my baby is only six.

My son is an inmate at the SCI-Marienville.  He 
has been a type 1 diabetic since age 11.  
Recently he has been experiencing severe low 
blood suguars, some as low as 26.  He has been 
written up (punished) by the guards for not 
standing up for the morning count.  He has tried 
on numerous occasions to tell them that he is low 
or that he has just eaten something to bring his 
sugar up.  He is now in the &quot;hole&quot; for 20 days.  
Yesterday, he was written up again because he 
could not get up for count.  His blood sugar 
level was 40.  I dont know what I can do to help 
him.  This problem will not go away.  He uses the 
insulin pump.  He was never able to tell he was 
low, now he just cannot get up or hear the bell 
to wake him at 6.  Please help we are at our wits 
end.  He was even trying to stay up all night to 
avoid oversleeping.

I have a question about how to go about handling 
a discrimination issue.  I need to register to 
take the ACT exam in order to be accepted into 
my program of study at college.  The test I need 
to take is in two weeks.  I am able to register 
for this particular test IF I don't disclose 
that I have a disability (Type I Diabetes).  
However, if I do select that I have a disability 
and require special accommodations I am directed 
to request a registration packet that is mailed 
and may take 7-10 days to arrive, which then has 
to be filled out and mailed back, adding an 
additional 7-10 days to the process.  Of course, 
this process eliminates my ability to register 
for this test.  I am upset that I am excluded 
from testing on this date ONLY because I have a 
disability, and for no other reason.  What steps 
should I take to remedy this situation?

Thank you,
Darlene Bennett

Dear Sirs,
I am looking for advocacy support and am not 
sure this is the right place.  Our son's 
pediatric endocrinologist directed us to use the 
pump.  We &quot;thought&quot; we had met all criteria and 
proceeded.  Anthem insurance, after pump therapy 
began, declared we hadn't had diabetes 
training.  Long and short, they used this poor 
excuse as a loop hole to not pay for the pump.  
We are facing the $5000 bill.  Can we get 
support to leverage Anthem to fulfill their 
responsibility?

Recently, I filled my son's perscriptions for 
test strips, insulin, glucogon, and keto strips.  
I was shocked when I went to the check out and 
the prices rang up over twice as much as they 
were last month.  The pharmacist told me to check 
with my insurance.  After talking to the 
insurance company, I was informed that 
the &quot;formulary&quot; had changed.  I assumed that that 
meant that all co-pays had increased as of the 
beginning of the year.  I had my husband's 
employer who provides the insurance look into 
it.  I was then told that no co-pays had 
increased, ONLY THE CO-PAY FOR DIABETES SUPPLIES 
had increased.  The co-pay for test strips 
doubled, and the co-pay for insulin tripled!  Can 
they legally do this?  They are singling out one 
type of patient and making them pay more.  I 
could understand, perhaps, if the cost of the 
items had increased.  But the truth is, that the 
cost of the test strips hasn't changed in over a 
year.  The insulin has slowly increased.  But why 
all of a sudden increase my out of pocket two to 
three times what it was?  Can they legally do 
this to just one patient group?

I currently have insurance through my employer. I
have been wearing an insulin pump for several
years now, when the pump shut down because of an
inspection due, the medical company kept it saying
the warrenty had expired and they could not be
responsible for the equipment I purchached any
longer. I then tried to get a new pump. My
insurance will only cover half the cost and at
that they have a $2000 a year cap on equipment
charges. I can't afford the other $3000 the new
pump will cost. I am currently using my old backup
pump untill it will be due for it's inspection and
I lose that one. I spent a lot of time in the ICU
unit before the pump and am not in a hurry to
return there. What can I do? Is there anyone that
can help?

I'm not positive that you will be able to answer a
question I have regarding diabetic coverage but I
thought I'd give it a try. I'm an insulin
dependent diabetic residing in NY. We were
recently forced to make a change in our HMO.
Currently we are insured by Empire Blue Cross of
NY. When I went to the pharmacy to fill my
prescfription for Insulin I was told that they
wouldn't cover insulin. I was under the impression
that as of 1993 according to a law passed in
NYState all insulin should be covered by insurance
providers. It has always been covered by our
previous HMO's, even when we didn't have a
prescription plan. Empire denied coverage citing
that since we don't have prescription coverage
they're not responsible for insulin. I'm concerned
for other diabetics out there who may not be able
to purchase insulin at $70 to $80 dollars a
bottle. I would appreciate any information you
could give me regarding this issue.
Respectfully

Your website is great!  A new Interscholastic 
League rule (5-11-2) was put into effect this 
year.  It says that during a 30-second time-out, 
no on-court entertainment should occur.  That 
means no player is supposed to be given water.  
I have a problem with this rule because my 17 
year old daughter has Type 1 Diabetes and often 
needs a drink of water if her BS is high or 
Gatorade if her BS is running low.  With this 
rule, she has to be taken out of the game in 
order to get a drink. Doesn't seem right to 
limit what can be done in a time out situation 
especially when it effects a players health!

This is not a question or comment but a plea for help.  I am typeI, 41, handicapped and pregnant!  We have an excellant insurande plan, thank goodness, that is until the mail order perscription plan had a glich which I thought to make you aware of.  Medco Health pushes it's members to use the mail order perscription plan and lures it's members with better prices.  It is almost as though you are being penalized for going to the local drug store.  We received our first order in December, a very cold day in December I might add!  Reorder time in March and I received my insulin at 7PM at night via UPS.  In the midwest or Northern States that might not mean a thing but we live in Arizona.  The package arrived baking HOT!  The two gel packs were liquid and extrememly HOT.  I called the customer service line and the woman I spoke to said that there is no shipment on the weekend, I told her I was pregnant and she said &quot;I'm sorry, there is no shipment on the weekend but it will be shipped on Monday or Tuesday of next week.  It was Friday, March 9.  The following Wednesday rolled around, no package, I opened my final bottle of humalog(I am on the pump) on Friday the 16th at 4PM we finally received a package, It was NOT the Humalog but the Lantus!  I was not even using the Lantus anymore and did not need it! The worse part was once again, the package arrived hot with only 1 gel pack inside.  I called the customer service again and asked to speak to a supervisor.  I felt as though I was speaking to a wall, deaf ears perhaps would have been more sympathetic to the situation!  Angela, the rep, said that the only ship UPS and that it is ALWAYS 2day air and there have NOT been complaints in the past from Arizona, New Mexico or Texas.  All of which they have clients who use insulin.  She asked if I wanted to speak to the pharmacist there.  I said yes and asked her to stay on the line that she may understand the importance of the situation.  I was so very wrong!  The pharmacist from Medco Health told me that I *should* be able to use the insulin, gave me the same line of malarky that the 'rep' gave me and continued to say, &quot;there should be no problem with the insulin.&quot; I told her that the insulin arrived hot to the touch and  I did not want to jeapordize my health and that of my baby with insulin that I felt was no longer usable.  She then said &quot;well if you really feel that it is that bad then don't use it, we will replace it.&quot; I said &quot;NO, you don't understand!  I am still waiting for my replacement on the Humalog and I no longer need the Lanus! Please! I need that Humalog!&quot;  She gave me a heavy sigh and said that the replacement was being processed, I should recieve it...NEXT WEEK! I was mortified!  She then (the pharmacist) gave me the standard blow off line for Medco Health, &quot;Is there anything more I can do for you?&quot; and I said no. She dropped off of the call and I continued to ask Angela if there was anyway to guarentee the  shipment for early am delivery to avoid the heat on the truck all day long.  She said &quot;NO. This is our standard for shipment and we do NOT make any exceptions! You don't understand.  If you were to see how your pharmacy receives it's insulin the manufacture ships the same way we do. Is there anything more I can do for you?&quot;  I said no but did not leave it at that.  I called Walgreens and the woman in pharmacy was shocked when I had said that Medco claims they receive thier insulin the same way, naturally, they do not.  It is shipped from the main Walgreens supplier on a refrigerated truck.  She added that other perishable items not at the supplier arrive early am via Fed Ex in a special thick stryofoam box with lots of gel packs in it.  I called UPS to inguire about their policy.  Apparently the lovely little bright red sticker that says &quot;RUSH!! Perishable! Immediate delivery!&quot; does not mean diddly to the driver.  The sender specifies how an item is to be shipped and unless they stress 24 hour ship, with early 10AM delivery,  it will NOT get there as I need it.  Medco ships 2 day delivery, 7PM guarenteed deliver time on the 2nd day. One more UPS tid-bit to add.  When my husband and I got married last August we had flowers shipped from California via UPS, on their web site it states that they are NOT respnsible for perishable items and that they are NOT a preferred perishibles carrier.  This being the case, why does Medco ship insulin via UPS?? I called back Medco and spoke to Angela again.  I told her of my conversations with both Walgreens and Medco.  She then said &quot;If you feel that we are not shipping this to your satisfaction I can send you the forms to appeal your case.  Is there anything more I can do for you?&quot;  That infuriated me!  I said no and she then said (word for word) &quot;ok fine! good-bye&quot; and hung up!  I cried for an hour after that and naturally the BS was over 200!  I called again  Monday, March 19th and the rep said that the Humalog had been shipped &quot;special&quot; 24 hour delivery!  FINALLY I thought, I made impact!  Tuesday I received it at 2PM, hot.  Why did this not surprise me.  I called and asked to speak to a supervisor...AGAIN.  I then got Ceretta.  She , like Angela was not interested in my plight.  The words life and death ment nothing to her.  I was in a complete state and in tears, at that point my husband took the phone.  He told her that this situation was unacceptable and that I needed my insulin.  She said &quot;I might be able to 24 hour  another shipment. Perhaps your wife can do without for one day, would you like to speak to a pharmacist and verify that?&quot; Yes, this is what she said.  My husband was livid at that point and asked to speak to HER superior.  She said that she is IT!  There was NO ONE else we could speak to on this matter!!  I was frightened and very worried.  I had had an incident the Sunday prior  where my site was not absorbing the insulin. In   3 hours I was up to 279!  I knew from my past and from experience that without the insulin, in 8 hours I could be in the hospital with ketoacidosis!  The odds for our unborn baby would not be good either.  He tried to convey this to her. &quot;I'm sorry sir that is the best I can do.  Is there anything more I can do for you?&quot; I had told him about the trick line and he then said &quot; don't hang up on me!&quot;  She did not, she put him on hold and never answered again.  The stress level in our home was over whelming!  I was truly worried about myself and the baby.  The next day , my husband called again.  He spoke to a rep that seemed a little more sympathetic.  He agreed to have Medco pay for a 30 day supply at our Walgreens. He also said it would be processed immediately and that our current perscription would be forwarded to them.  We were so relieved!  Unfortunately we got notification from Walgreens that our request to pick up the Humalog was denied by the insurance company.  WE HAD ALREADY RECEIVED A 90 DAY SUPPLY VIA MAIL ORDER AND IT WAS TOO SOON FOR REFILL!!  I cried for hours thinking I was soon going to have no insulin and no way of getting it other than paying the retail.  Humalog being as pricy as it was would put us in a bind but we had no choice.  When we did get this straightend out, the pharmacist at  Walgreens keyed it in as a 23 day supply and magicly, it went through!  1 vial of insulin only!  Despite a new perscription from my Dr's office that stated I needed 4 vials for a 30 day supply I was ALLOWED only 1 vial of insulin from Medco Health.  We picked up the other 4 vials and paid the retail for them, 297.00.  I am aggrevated and upset, frustrated and completely worn from this situation!  What can we do??  Oh, the appeals forms?  One week later and we still have not received them.  Apparently it is 7 to 10 days do send and the appeals department has NO e-mail and NO phone number!  The only way to contact them is via USPS! Go figure.    I have insulin for a month or so... but what then?  This can't be it?   Are we going to pay the full retail for my insulin from now on because Medco  insists that their way works?  I am truly frightened that at one point we will experience problems with this.  What can we do??

Thank You so much for reading my long note, I hope there is someone there who can help us or get this information to someone who can.  There are others who use Medco.  I know after speaking to my insulin pump teaching nurse, that this happens OFTEN!  Someone uses the insulin from Medco and Apria, the next day, the BS are off the charts!  It is a horrid situation, one that needs to be rectified.  Three shipments of insulin thrown away and all because they did not want to spend an additional 10-15.00 dollars to ship them.  

Thank You again,
Maryann Maltman

Love the site, love the forum, great info, easy 
to use. Thank you! I am just starting out with my 
diabetic child's education and need to go 
somehwere for info on how to deal with Special ed 
committee. Any info on advocacy, legal help, or 
specific laws for diabetic child in schools. Any 
thing I research seems as though it's just 
a &quot;guideline&quot; for schools. My main issue is I 
want the district to have Diabetes educator come 
in to train the teachers etc. not the school 
nurse. The district is saying no. However, they 
have had diabetes educators come in to school 
previously for other diabetic children in past 
years.  Don't they have to follow some &quot;past 
practice&quot; guidelines, in other what they've done 
in the past for others, is what my child is 
entitled to. Yikes, I went for a meeting and I 
felt as though it was 8 against 1!I am in a small 
suburb outside Albany, New york.

I have two suggestions to increase the number of 
people who have diabetes to know that they have 
this disease. Right now, I believe there are 
around 14 million people with diabetes that do 
not even know they have it.

1) One way, is to make sure doctors, and that 
includes Surgeons, to inform patients when their 
fasting blood glucose levels are above 129. My 
husband had a reading of 170 for a 12 hour 
fasting glucose level. Yet, the Surgeon failed 
to inform my husband that he was a diabetic or 
even tell him to make an appointment with his 
family doctor because his blood glucose level 
was above 129. So three years later, my husband 
took a blood test only to find his levels above 
300. So for three years, my husband's glucose 
has been damaging his organs, his nervous 
system, his eyes, and permanantly destroying his 
beta cells. 

I believe his story is very familiar to many 
diabetics. We need to make sure, by letting 
heads of hospitals, tell their doctors in all 
physician meetings, to make sure they check 
blood test results - that includes blood tests 
taken just before surgery.

2) With Congress right now trying to pass a new 
drivers license, the government should also tie 
into the law, that blood test results for 
diabetes be taken with the drivers license, or 
once every four years. It could be the simple 
glucose test that only takes a quick prick on 
the finger without a person fasting ahead of 
time. Then, the drivers license bureau would 
suggest that the person see their doctor for 
more formal tests to determine if he or she is a 
diabetic.

I am an attorney representing an individual with 
type 2 diabetes who was denied a job as a 
sanitation worker with the New York City 
Department of Sanitation because his glucose 
level was elevated when he was administered a 
medical examination.  It was determined his 
diabetes was not under control.  In the 
administrative process we submitted lab tests for 
three successive months showing his glucose level 
was well within normal limits as well as a note 
from his doctor stating that his diabetes was 
under control.  Nonetheless, we lost in the 
administrative process and are now preparing to 
file in state court to challenge that 
determination.  Are you aware of any cases in New 
York State that might be helpful?  Also, if a 
person fails a test only once, does the burden 
shift to him to prove his diabetes in under 
control and, if so, how is that done other than 
producing lab tests and a statement from the 
person's doctor?  Conversely, when the 
prospective employer is relying on one test given 
during a 15 year period in which the individaul 
had diabetes and states it has never impacted his 
ability to work, is there a burden on the 
prospective employer to show more than the one 
test it relies on?

My grandaughter has had diabetes since she was 
seven years old and is now 11 years old. She has 
contacted mononucleosis and is very sick. Of 
course, this will affect her BS's. The hospital 
here in Cabarrus County, NC sent her home last 
week and we found out the diagnosis several days 
later. She was, however, allowed to return to 
school. She went to school yesterday, 2/12/07, 
but needed to be picked up due to a severe 
headache. Now, she was vomiting again this am and 
her physician has admitted her back into the 
hospital with dehydration and high blood sugars. 
I would like to know why they would even send her 
home and allow her to return to school? It seems 
she would be infectious to other students and 
faculty. I am not surprised she is back in the 
hospital. It is very hard to control her diabetes 
when she is sick at home. We try very hard to 
prevent the dehydration, but I would like to have 
a doctor's orders to get her started on IV's at 
home. I am a registered nurse, although I am 
working in a micro lab at the time. I can start 
IV's and take care of her at home. Do you think 
this advisable? Also, do you think she should 
spend more time in the hospital due to this 
serious situation. Her liver is inflammed from it 
and her backaches and headaches along with the 
vomiting are a real problem. Please advise!

Hello ADA,My name is Edwin Rivera and I've had 
diabetes since the age of 14.I am now close to 
hitting the age of 55 and after so many years of 
injecting myself it has just gotton me so 
tired.I am under a doctors care in which I had 
seen on 3-6-07.I've tried my best to keep my 
blood level as normal as I can but it's a very 
frustrating thing to do to balance your meal 
your activity and your insulin to work 
together.The doctor then mention the insulin 
pump he gave me information to read on how the 
insulin pump works.I had my sister call to just 
find out the price of this insulin pump if in 
case someone would wished to have one.I could 
not believe how much it would cost for someone 
who might wish to have one who has no 
insurance.I have Blue Cross Blue Sheild and and 
spoke to one of the representives to find out 
how much out of pocket money I will have to pay 
it will still be draining on me,what gets me so 
upset and angry is that for someone like me and 
others who have had diabetes for so long cannot 
be given the insulin pump since the Medical 
Association is so concern about people lives and 
health,so I hope and would appreciate if you 
maybe able to give me a avenue that I maybe able 
to have a insulin pump if thier is no way to 
just be given one for I am not a rich man just 
like so many others who just wished they could 
have an insulin pumped,but you know and I know 
that their main interest is just making money 
and not truly caring about a person health 
otherwise they would have made the insulin pump 
affordable or simply free of charge.I will 
appreciate your help on this matter or whatever 
help.              Thank You Edwin Rivera

No problem with the web site.
Background to my question is: my boss/company required me to work 17+ hours, get 4 hours sleep, then was requiring me to work another 14 to 18 hour day. My boss knows that I have diabetes, high blood pressure and had a cardiac problem in 2004.
Questions: 1- was I wrong in refusing to put my health at risk by not working the overtime the next day? 2 - is there protection for me from such actions in the future?

I am currently an older aged college student on medicaid. I was originally put on medicaid due to cataract surgery. Then, was diagnosed with diabetes. Through various incidences (incurred pain due to three surgeries in four years, being physically attacked and, my mother dying of a terminal illness) my sugar levels rose uncontrollaby and put on two insulins, then recently discovered with kidney disease with possibility of glucoma.

Medicaid is trying to get me off their disability rolls. What are my options? This is extremely stressful since I am currently trying to finish up my bachelor's degree within 3 semesters (I only have two more semesters to go). They refuse to recognize this is such a short time to complete a degree. They would rather have me work a low paying minimum wage job (predictably without benefits) than attempt to try to get a more secured position with a degree.

Even though I maintain my health using insulin and kidney meds, the county doesn't consider it disabling if I go without insulin if I can't afford it.

Even if I work, the cost of necessities (rent, utilities, food and commuting costs) plus paying for my meds and doctors would overwhelm me since my medicines only exceed $400 a month. How would I cover my other bills?  (Add in I have been in living at the YWCA all these years, I haven't been able to move out since I can't afford the high cost of rent in the area.)

Where can I get low-cost if no cost medicines, supplies and find doctors? How can I obtain insurance once I am dropped from medicaid? Won't this make obtaining insurance more difficult with a pre-existing condition?  Wouldn't this make it more expensive and possibly keep me from getting it?

I am scared since I have been actively trying to find out my options and have only found out limited information (someone with a family, recently unemployed) nothing pertaining to me (single, woman, and college student with diabetes).

What do I do?  Wait until the rug is pulled out from me at the last moment and literally get ill from lack of meds while trying to complete college?  Or drop college right at the end of finals week (my gpa is 3.5). Go get a minimum wage job with no benefits watch as I get older and sicker, then get benefits more ill as a result?

The NINA Foundation is a non profit health club for kids.  We offer personalized training, homework assistance and mentoring for kids in our Fit For Education After School Program.  We are adding a quarterly newsletter as a family involvement project, and one of our goals is to promote healthy living for the families that we service.  Is there any way that the ADA would be able to collaborate with a small organization on advocacy and awareness?   

Most of the children that we service have more than one risk factor for type two diabetes.  Are there any posters, pamplhets or other information that the ADA has that may help us to broaden our advocacy?

We also have space to provide for guest speakers and workshops.  If you don't have the staff available, we would love to provide your information within some of the networks that we are in.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to this question.

I do have a problem with your web-site. Your position on Stem Cell Research is not &quot;the wishes of the people&quot; as you indicate. I am not going to get into an ethical debate with you. However, I believe that using embryonic stem cells from killed fetuses is wrong. Why don't you ask the &quot;people's&quot; opinion before you assume everyone is pro-abortion. Rather than kill the innocent and helpless, why not use your energy promoting adult stem cells taken from the individuals bone marrow? Which is currently offering hope to millions of cardiac patients. I work as a family nurse pratitioner with diabetics every day. Why don't you promote diet and exercise which can prevent diabetes. Look at all the over-weight children we have right now. It is a national epidemic as you should know...

I wanted to speak to someone about my concerns at work. What can I request or expect from my organization. I have been a diabetic for a little over a year and I don't want to be a bother to my organization, but I am concerned about my health. 

My concerns are all of my Doctor's appointment and I had requested a refrigerator for my emergency kit and healthy snacks instead of using the refrigerator everyone using. In the event of an emergency, the last thing I want to worry about is if the person looking for my kit can find it. Our community refrig is also cleaned out every week, so I am always having to buy more stuff to store. What are my rights?

It seems that ColdStone Creamery has pulled their nutritional information from their website.  When you call the customer service number listed to request the information, they still can't give it to you.  It has something to do with a new New York City Health Code they are unable to comply with so they've pulled all the information.  Well, I live in North Carolina and they've pulled the information from me as well.

My son is on an insulin pump.  We went to Cold Stone as a treat and now we can't find out how many carbs were in his ice cream.  I was transferred from person to person.  Spoke to every supervisor &quot;available&quot; to me and got the same run around from everyone there.  I was given the Corporate number for ColdStone but was also told that they were closed because it was Saturday evening.

It seems that no one understands this is unacceptable when you have a child with rising blood sugars because your best guess about what he just ate isn't good enough.  We've always used the website in the past to secure this information.  How can they legally pull this information?  How can they publish a number to call to get the information only to be told it is not available?  Is any of this legal?

I am very upset and felt that what should have been a nice family evening has been ruined due to misinformation and the unwillingness of ColdStone to release this information to me.

I was told that customer service no longer has the nutritional information either.  The statement about calling them on the website is only so they can email a liason that will then &quot;contact&quot; you with appropriate information.  So they never actually said I could get the information.  Of course, this is only during business hours for whom ever this mysterious person is that &quot;may&quot; hold all the nutritional information.  Can they really do this?

Do you have any suggestions of what can be done about this other than to avoid ColdStone Creamery (which of course my son loves as a treat!) ?  None of this seems entirely legal to me.

I am the vice president of my local union with the City of Detroit, SAAA. I have an employee who is a diabetic.  She has problems with incontenence and body odor which has been documented by a physician.  She has been suspended from work twice by management for poor hygene, which is not the issue.  She is currently suspended for 15 days without pay.  they are attempting to document this to terminate her employment.  Under the AM with Dis Act, I do not believe they have cuase but I am looking for additional material to present at a hearing on her behalf.  She is insulin dependent and on an oral agent as well.  Under extreme stress her sugars are going up not down and this has become a real threat to her and her well being as well as her continued employment.  I need some serious information, court decisions, arbitration decisions, anything I can get my hands on to defend her and get this all removed from her record.

I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself for over 40 years so in addition to empathy, I have experience.

I have had Type 1 diabetes for 33 years now. Due to lack of finances and lack of insurance,I have not been able to manage it very well throughout my adult life. I entered into the workforce at 21. I had numerous jobs, but was seeking one that would provide me with afforadable insurance. Throughout the course of about 8 years, Ihad finally found one at a factory that would provide such after 90 days from date of hire. However, by the time I had achived the goal of finding this job, I could not work it due to the fact that my body just could not take anymore, nor could it wait for 90 day period for the insurance to take effect. They had to fire me due to poor job performance.
I then applied for disability, got on Medicaid, and was able to start treating the diabetes. However, while being denied over and over for my disability, I had lost my car and could not find rides to my apointments. Thus I was in the same situation as I was without insurance. I received my final denial of the disability insurance in 2000. I was weary of fighting the SSA, so I did not apply for it any further. 
Even with the Foodstamps and Medicaid, I could not afford fresh fruits and vegetables. I could not afford at times the $3.oo co-pay for my medicaitions. I could not afford paying bills.
Currently, I am looking for work and actually have a job waiting for me, but my car is broken down and I have no money for paying someone to take me to get fill out the application, nor to take me to the job when I do get hired.
To sum all of this up, my question is this: is there any help out there for situations as these specifically for people with diabetes? If not, then why? I heard of a lady who has diabetes that has not been to a doctor for 5 years because she cannot afford it, and she has been denied medicaid due to her supposedly owning a house, although her daughter is paying the house off.
I know that there is some help in getting certain diabeteic supplies and medications from the manifactures of the drugs and products, however that does not help someone who may need to get to the store but doesn't have a car because they can't afford one, Or, if they do have one they cannot afford the gas.Even people on supplimental incomes cannot afford these type of things after paying bills.
I think that it would be a good idea to advocate programs that specifically target these issues for people that have Diabetes, on a local, State, and Federal level. I don't know of any programs of such nature. If there is, please let me know. I would be willing to help get this in up and going in any way that I could. I see too many people with this disease are hurting more than just medically to just turn a blind eye to.
I have seen and appreciate what ADA has done, keep up the good work, but I beleive that it is the people out here, along with orginaztions such as the ADA, that need to push to get these kind of programs funded by the Government and anybody else who has the resources for these type of things to get put into place.
I apologize for such a long correspondance, but I see a BIG need here that really has been overlooked as far as to what I have seen in my personal experiences.
Thank you for reading this and Godspeed,
Respectivly,
Rob Myers

My husband works for a potato chip company as a delivery/route driver. Company doesn't require a CDL. His immediate supervisors were aware of his diabetes (Type 1), he did not make a point of telling anyone at the home office (wasn't hiding it, just never came up). He was at the warehouse a few weeks ago, loading his truck and had a reaction, paramedics were called, he was okay. Since then, a VP in the company has: requested he go see a doctor and have a medical release signed, pestered him about going, and now has said (in front of witnesses) if my husband has another reaction and the paramedics have to be called, he will be out of a job. Isn't all this against the law!? Threatening to fire him is blatant discrimination as far as I can tell. What about requesting the medical release? Since they don't require a CDL, can they require the medical release? They haven't asked it of any other employee. I'm starting to look through the laws, but I'm not finding anything specific enough and there is so much to look through. Can you give me some advice? or at least tell me which specific laws they are breaking?

Hello, I am a 58 year old male with type 2 diabetes. I had osteomyelitis in my right foot resulting in mid-foot ammputation. I also suffer from Charcot Foot in my left foot. For the last 4 years my proffession has been an &quot;over the road&quot; truck driver. I have 2 issues or comments.
1.) Why are the doctors, especially podiatrists,
unable to detect or inform the patient of Charcot Foot? I was seeing a podiatrist for a pain in my left foot. I thought unusual because of neuropathy (sp), it was dismissed as a sore foot and I was given a shot of cordizone. In less than 6 weeks the pain was unbelievable and the foot had deformed. I saw the doctor and then I was told I suffered from Charcot Foot. Should
doctors be making their patients aware that there
can be a possibility of Charcot Foot?
2.) As a professional truck driver now aware of 
most of the &quot;side effects of diabetes. I believe
much stricter rules regarding the operation of an 80,000 lbs vehicle by drivers diagnosed with
diabetes should be in effect. Upon an accident
involing a commercial vehicle the authorities
check for alcohol, and drugs. I think they should also test blood sugar levels. Most of time
the authorities say the driver fell asleep. they have not been in a truck stop to see the overweight condition of a large number of drivers, or their dietary habits, sugar and carbs. Get the D.O.T. involved in this issue.
Thank you,

Your website is so easy to find what I need. Thank you and God bless all who help the ADA.

My son is 24 and a Type I diabetic. He and his family have recently moved in with us. He has just started a job, earning less than minimum wage for a probationary period. He has no medical insurance and has been told by DHS that he does not qualify for any medical help. He cannot afford his insulin or test strips. Please help us if you can. Arkansas has extremely poor medical coverage for people who need it.

I would appreciate any help you can give us concerning this matter. I thank you in advance for your help in this matter.

I myself would enjoy being an advocate for this cause. My husband is on disability and I do not work so our income is extremely limited. But perhaps there is something I can do to help. I nearly lost my son twice from this disease and I am willing and able to help however I can. It is only by the grace of God that he is with us today.

Again, I thank you in advance for any help in this matter.

I would like to know what is going to be done with Privacy Act.  My son is 19. He is away at college.  He was hospitalized twice for illness related to his diabetes.  The first time he spent the day there and called me later that day.  The second time he was in intensive care for a few days.  He told the school administration to call his parents.  My problem is that he is not usually thinking correctly when he a has a health problem.  If he had not specifically told them to contact us, he could have been hospitalized with us have any knowledge that his health had been compromised.  

One other example similar to this happened to his room mate.  His room mate tried to commit sucide.  He left a note and cut himself.  He was taken to the hospital.  His parents were not notified.  This was a Saturday night.  On Tuesday, his parents called my son's cell phone to find their son.  My son was put in the position of telling them that their had been in the hospital since Saturday.  This is all happening because after the child turns 18 we can give all of our information for any form of financial aid and our health insurance covers the child, however the parents can no longer be given any notification unless the child specifically requests it on a case by case basis.

Who is this really protecting?  Certainly it is hindering my child getting the proper care.  If my child was really a separate entity he would no longer require my financial information, finances and insurance coverage.  This act is so one sided.  We need recourse.

My husband lost all kidney function a little over a year ago and is now on dialysis.  My brother died suddenly last December at the age of 41.  I know everyone has issues in their life but I am really struggling right now.  Do you have any suggestions on how I can keep my job?  Can I really be fired for having complications due to my diabetes? Please send me an answer via e-mail if you can.

My Daughter is attending a school that shares a nurse throughout BEA School District.  We had our 504 meeting and nothing was accomplished. They want me to transfer her to another school in our district where a nurse would be available.  I just wanted to know my rights for this action that want to do?  I do know this is not a good idea, as per we moved here 2 years ago from out of state.  And to do this would be harmful. She is undergoing a pyschiatrist at this time dealing with separation of me and my husband and her leaving all of her friends.

I am not an advocate and I will not be as long as you advocate research into embryonic stem cell research.  If you read and listen to actual scientific research you come to the conclusion that the great hope is not in embryonic but in adult stem cell research and in fact, embryonic research suggest that those types of cells hold more potential for harm than good given their &quot;free radical&quot; nature.  I think your advocacy of  ESC research is irresponsible and, yes, immoral no matter what the federal guidelines are.

Question:  Why do you seem to ignore that risk?

I am a 51 year old male who, several years ago, was diagnosed with diabetes.  I am on oral medication (metformin) and trying to lose weight.  My current job is in the optical retail business at Davis Vision.  My hours are as follows: Tue: 10-6:30, Wed: 12-8:30, Thu: 9-5:30, Fri: 12-8:30, Sat: 8:30-4:30.  
Because of the varied hours, I am unable to keep my sleep pattern consistent and, therefore, feel fatigue often.  I also have difficulty taking medication, required after meals, at the same time every day because my meal times differ each day.  I also have problems seeing at night which creates a problem driving home from work in the dark.  I would be better able to care for my health needs if I could work 9-5:30 during the week (other employees have more than one 9-5:30 day scheduled).  Is this an unreasonable accommodation to ask of my employer?

I am writing in regard to a policy of the MA police association.An article in the Boston Globe&quot;Insulin pump presents hurdle for aspiring officer&quot;notes that a young man was refused a position as a police officer based on the fact that he wears a pump.It states that a firefighter can be hired and that a police officer, once hired may wear a pump but that at the time of application you can be refused.
How does such a policy exist in a state know for it's medical research? I do not know this man but am enraged that such an archaic policy is allowed.
I am asking that you look into this matter.It is not just this man but all of us trying to live&quot;just like everybody else&quot; that it hurts.

My daughter (Audrie)_will be starting Kindergarten this coming fall and we are in the process of establishing/setting up a 504 plan for her.  The principal of the school will not allow and is adament that Audrie's regualr classroom teacher not check Audrie's blood sugar or touch/handle her pump.  According to him, this is the nurse's duty. While the school does have a full-time nurse, I would like to know if this is right/legal.The nurse will have to come to Audrie in the classroom/outside, etc. to test her blood sugar, bolus, and administer Glucagon (this includes snacks eaten in the classroom).  I am concerned that if an emergency would occur (an extreme low), especially during recess and/or PE, that time will be wasted waiting on the nurse to respond. She is often times not in her room and has other people covering her desk.  Audrie just started pumping last July and does not know or realize yet when her blood sugar is high or low.  She is also not yet regulated and her blood sugars fluctuate greatly throughout the day, as we are still trying to find the correct basal rates. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you so much!

Sincerely,
Wendy Nixon

I have been working at my current job for almost a year now.  I work one evening shift a week and take a dinner break during that shift.  As with any meal, I would always have my food prepared in front of me and would then administer my insulin injection by opening a single button in my shirt to expose a small portion of my abdomen.  Afterwards, I would pack up my used supplies to take home for disposal.

I was recently told by my supervisor that I am not allowed to test my blood sugar or administer my injection in our kitchen.  I have been told that I need to use the public restroom, which I consider very unsanitary or my office, which I consider too far from the kitchen and my food.  The walk from my office to the kitchen would take me through the public areas of the workplace, possibly subjecting me to being stopped by a patron for service, which I consider unsafe if I have just taken insulin but cannot get to my food.

Do I have any recourse in this matter or do I need to comply with my supervisor's wishes?  Thanks.

Sincerely,
Jeremy A. White-Zeager

I am trying to get a job as a correction officer. I have type 1 diabetes. I called to ask for assistance of my having to manage my diabetes with insulin and my need to use insulin and a meter. I told human resources I needed to bring in my stuff and she told me she didn't think it would be a problem and then she tranfered me to the training officer at the training academy because she wasn't sure. This person told me I would probably have to leave them in the car and could not bring them in. He said, &quot;it was because hypothetically jails and prisons are a controlled environment but that every place was different.&quot; I did not get a locker offer from this guy. What can I do because now I am uncertain. I really do not want to make these kind of complaints formally because the agency is hiring and I am in the selection process. Educationally, I can not wait until a medical evaluation or such time to talk about this. My question is can people who need to use medications for their health such as diabetics bring their meds into these places if they work there because I do not find it reasonable to leave it in my car.

I need some information.  My 26yo daughter in Fla. is a type one diabetic with a medtronic pump.  Before she got it she contacted both her insurance company and medtronic. Medtronic told her the pump was covered except for $100 copay. Now the insurance company has paid all they are going to pay and Medtronic says she owes $2700. They are delaying as she is appealing the charge. She had a similar problem with annimas with her first pump.  They seems cruel to people who already have great expense and health issues to deal with on a daily basis.  She budgets and would not have purchased the pump if it were not affordable.  Is there any help for situations like this other than get everything in writing and pay them?

Hi,

Thanks very much for your leadership in the area of diabetes advocacy.  I work at a diabetes care pharmaceutical company, and became aware of the ADA through events my company enthusiastically supports, such as the Tour de Cure.  I was a bit surprised, however, when I looked on ADA's Advocacy page and didn't find any reference to the Farm Bill presently under debate in Congress.  In short, this legislation has historically driven down prices of junk food, which in turn has helped fuel the epidemic of diabetes we're facing today.  This dynamic has been popularized in such books as &quot;The Omnivore's Dilemma&quot; by Michael Pollen, and &quot;FoodFight&quot; by Daniel Imhoff.  The following passage from http://www.watershedmedia.org/foodfight_overview.html nicely sums up the situation:

***
It only takes a stroll down the supermarket aisles to understand how Farm Bill dollars flow into the country's food chain. A dollar buys hundreds of more calories in the snack food, cereal, or soda aisles than it does in the produce section. Why? Because the Farm Bill favors the mega-production of corn (resulting in cheap high-fructose corn syrup) and soybeans rather than regional supplies of healthy vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Unfortunately, eating a diet high in calories doesn't necessarily ensure that one is well-fed -- even if that food is cheap...

Our challenge may not be to abolish government supports altogether, but to ensure that those subsidies we do choose to legislate actually serve as valuable investments in the country's future and allow us to live up to our obligations in the global community. How we get there is still to be determined. But most observers agree that the era of massive giveaways to corporations and surplus commodity producers must yield to policies that reward stewardship, promote healthy diets, secure regional economies, and do no harm to family farms or hungry kids and their families. 
***

I had hoped to rally my colleagues here at work to action by pointing them to your website.  Does the ADA have any plans to weigh in on this very important legislation?

Thanks again for all your great work, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Jim Borninski

Hi there,

I hate bothering anyone, but I am having a personal problem in relation to my diabetes and my employment. I am having a problem finding an advocate to speak to. Can you assist or direct me to assistance?

Thank you in advance for your time,

My daughter is going into 8th grade in Dub. Ia. She has autism and type 1 Diabetes. She has a health care plan and an I.E.P. unfortunately in Iowa her health care plan is not a legal document but in her I.E.P.it states under support and related services it states'daily blood sugar mngmnt per physician and parent request'. So we have had trouble all last year getting them to do what was asked of them; such as sending her lunch blood sugars home following her daily exercise plan,she fell asleep twice at school,did not take her to the nurse to have her blood sugar checked[although her c are plan clearly states she should ,she carries that around with her in her agenda] they also did not give her a scheduled afternoon snack because she was at an assembly. I repeatedly had to ask for info on what they were doing in P.E.[she has it every other day] no anser from her paraprofessional so I chased the gym teachers around all year.She has 1 more year at that school. How do I get these people to comply? Plus it's difficult to get good blood sugar control if I don't know what's going on at school . Also am very nervous about sending her back there if they can't do the things that are written down in front of them.They also gave her chocolate milk instead of white at lunch for 2weeks when I had white written down in her agenda. Her A1c was 7.7 at beginning ao school year went to an 8.4 then 8.9 she has always passed her A1c's until this year. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. tank you.

We just returned from a trip to Club Med.  Our family signed up for scuba diving lessons and a scub diving trip at this Club Med.  My son, Gabriel is 18 and Type I diabetic since age 10 and successfully uses an insulin pump.  His HBA1C is always below 6.7

Gabriel informed the diving staff  immediately that he has diabetes and spoke with the physician in charge.  He showed the doctor his insulin pump and explained how it worked.  She told him there was no reason to keep him from diving.

Gabriel did the first scuba lesson in the Club swimming pool with the rest of the family.  Coincidentally, the diving instructor was a Type I diabetic for eighteen years and had been diving safely for sixteen years.  The lesson went well.

The next day, Gabriel and the family returned to take the second lesson.  Gabriel was informed abruptly   that he COULD NOT scuba dive because he had diabetes. Gabriel was told that he was &quot;too much of a liability&quot; for diving. 

Later I spoke to the diving staff.  Apparently, the manager of the scuba office had downloaded information stating that the pressure underwater could effect insulin levels and that a person could become &quot;unconscious&quot; from too much activity. The manager was totally misinformed and thought that Gabriel needed access to additional insulin underwater while diving and exerting physical effort.  

I tried to explain to the scuba staff that Gabriel knew how to adjust his blood glucose to accomodate activity and that he did not need insulin, but extra glucose if he was active.  The scuba manager, John Lee, replied that this had &quot;nothing to do with blood glucose&quot; but was about insulin.  He was under the impression that the symptoms of low sugar he read about on the website required more insulin. It was unimaginably frightening to think that a diabetic  with hypoglycemia would be given more insulin.

Neither the physician nor the staff knew what glucagon was and they had no idea how to treat a diabetic emergency.  They had no emergency glucose supplies or insulin on hand.

Gabriel researched the criteria for safe diving  for diabetics on the Divers Alert Network (DAN). Gabriel met the age requirement, the HBA1C requirement, the average blood sugar requirement and understood the requirements for blood glucose  on the day of the dive as described by DAN. Gabriel explained this to the staff, but they ignored the information even though DAN is the main source of diving information for Club Med's staff and DAN certifies their scuba program.

Club Med cannot discriminate against Gabriel like this. There was no reason to keep him from diving and he was quite distraught and embarassed, as was the rest of our family.  The ignorance and the fear of the diving staff was unacceptable.  The Chief of the Club Med village was just as uneducated about diabetes and could not give us a reason why this happened.

We want to take legal action against Club Med, but most urgently, we want their Diving Certification cancelled until their staff has a basic understanding of diabetes, diabetic safety and the actual requirements for safe scuba diving for persons with diabetes.  Respectful and educated treated of indivduals with diabetes is a must for Club Med and all organizations.

Please advise.

Thank you

Marion Arom, Ph.D.

In a recent Diabetes Forecast article re qualilty health care for all, several national groups were given credit for working together.  I just wanted to make you aware of another organization.  OWL, The Voice of Midlife and Older Women (formerly the Older Women's League)has advocated for health care for all since the early 1980s. The national office is in Arlington, VA with local groups in 23 states. Their most recent effort was the 2007 Mother's Day Report entitled &quot;Give &quot;Em Health: Medicare-For-All&quot;, released to Congress in May.  While OWL works to raise awareness of health care issues facing women, we live and work with families.  Women have a high stake in the debate surrounding health care.  Many are among the uninsured or underinsured.  I recommend that you look at their report and include them the next time you organize an advocacy effort.  The National OWL can be reached at 703-812-7990 or contact them through their website: www.OWL-National.org.  Thanks for your continued advocacy.  Maybe if we all join together, we really will be heard in Congress and the White House.

My friends and I are in the early planning stages of a cross country bicycle trek.  It occurred to me that we may be in a situation to raise funds for a charity with our venture. One of the early obstacles we have encountered is the cost of an organized (supported) tour. It can run as much as $6.5K to $9K per cyclist.  If we can raise a sufficient amount of pledges can ADA help us with some of the expenses?

I was in training to be a substitute bus driver for the City of Arlington, WA.  I was in their classes for about 2 weeks.  During this time upon their recommendation I paid for and took several tests required to become licensed.  When I called to schedule my required physical I was told that I could not obtain a school bus driver's endorsement for my CDL license if I was insulin dependent.  About 6 weeks ago my ACL1 was 6.1.  As of today my sugar averaged 100 for the past 2 weeks and 104 for the past 30 days. I drive my car everyday and take great care not to go hypoglycemic.  I golfed 18 holes today...no problem.  I'm 59 years old and have been looking for employment for the past 3 years.  I was excited about finding this position and being invited into the training program.  At the time of my interview nothing was said about insulin nor was possibility of exclusion because of insulin ever mentioned in the class room or class room printed materials.  I would not be an unsafe driver.  Can you help me?

Why is there NO assistance for low income working families with minimal insurance who still must pay exorbitant co-pays for new insulin medications? My grandson is on oral medication but still requires 4 insulin injections daily. Co-pay on insulin alone is 300.00/month; with oral meds, it's over $600/mo.which is 75%-plus of monthly income. Is there no help on this? He goes without sometimes because he can't afford it. Is there any help?

How come people who live in San Diego, do not want to help people with Diabetes, it is as if they want us to die or have complications, their food at their Senior Centers is old and moldy or it is all bread, lots of sugar products, that you have to pay two dollars for. Lots of salty foods things that have high fat content. Were I live in Fallbrook, the Meals on Wheels program will not come there, it is to far for them., we have to pay a high rent to live there the waiting list is 5 years away. People are dying from this disease in Fallbrook,CA which is in San Diego's north county. What has happened to people I tried to get a lawyer for help , if we do not have money you have no rights, someone who used to be a judge and lives in our complex and used to work for the military was told that Seniors in San Diego have no rights.  I want to change that. People in Long Beach,CA are warehoused into board and cares, if they can not pay the rent they are thrown out into the street. They do not dare to fall a sleep at night, they get a ticket, Or they put them in jail. This is very unsetling to me. Does this make you upset. They do not want to hire you because of insurance reasons.  It seems that Seniors are not wanted anymore. They no longer have any dignity,people with Diabetes, it is even harder. What are we going to do about it.

I am attaching a letter written to a sales represenative at Mini- Med.
I am a pump user and have been for 8 years.
I was fortunate to live in Massachusetts and not have to pay for my pump.
A year ago I moved to the state of Maine and am employed by a Quality Assurance company in New Hampshire. My pump is out  of warrenty and the letter will explain how I  got into that situation.
My concerns regarding pump users are the out of pocket cost in states other than Massachusetts.
The ability of the main pump supplier to change the up grade policy without notifying the customer.
The ability that the pump supplier has to upgrade the pump without backing up the new pump.
The profit of the pump companies is in the supplies. How is it the insurance companies have the permisssion to acept or deny somone a pump. How is it when the pump is able to contain health care cost it is being made so difficult to obtain.
What are you doing about it? How is it you are not more pro active in regards to pump users. How is it that the benefits regarding diabetic supplies in the Commonwealth of Mass have not  been duplicated in every state?
What holds you and others hostage to the insurance companies and the suppliers?
The following is the letter I wrote yet again expressing my frustration at the system that provides services to diabetics at the diabetics expense.

Mike Norwood 
Diabetes Management Consultant 
Medtronic MiniMed 
 
Dear Mr. Norwood,
Hello, I hope all is well.
Please excuse my delay in responding to your e-mail about the change in policy about Medtronic's updating their customers for pump upgrades. 
 
Each of us faces choices in health care. For some of us it is a choice regarding whether we live or die for others it is a choice of profit. 
Choices and decisions abound in today's health care.
COI estimates are often cited as an important element in the choices made about diabetes care and management. 
Health care industries and pharmaceutical companies use the COI report so they can project their market so they can make their profit. Government and insurance companies use the COI report to project cost. 
 
In regards to your company your profit projection for 2007 is as follows, for diabetes:
  MEDTRONIC, INC.
REVENUE BY OPERATING SEGMENT - WORLD WIDE
($ Millions) 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
FY 06 FY 06 FY 06 FY 06 FY 06 FY 07 FY 07 FY 07 FY 07 FY 07 
QTR 1 QTR 2 QTR 3 QTR 4 Total QTR 1 QTR 2 QTR 3 QTR 4 Total 
DIABETES $ 173 $ 178 $ 182 $ 188 $ 722 $ 196 $ 212 $ - $ - $ 408
 
 
The Direct cost of diabetes estimated to have risen to $137 billion per year. 
�         Diabetes alone represents 11%of the US health care expenditure. People with diabetes have medical expenditures 2.4 times higher than they would if they did not have diabetes.
 
Medtronic cites that with the use of the pump they have proven they have reduced health care cost for diabetics 
Yet, in your letter you cite that &quot;you have to tred lightly with insurance companies&quot;... I am puzzled.
One of the managers at your company related to me the insurance companies where Medtronic's customer as that is who paid you. I all along had believed I was the customer as I pay you as well as the insurance company. Yet, another representative of Medtronic's told me that several people had voiced complaints regarding the fact that your company made the decision not to notify pump users when they could upgrade and that your company did not notify its customers that they made that decision. 
 
The insurance company that I deal with profit for 2006 was and the projection for 2007 
* Medical enrollment grew to 34.9 million members, increasing by 774,000 members during the quarter * Net income was $1.26 per share, exceeding prior guidance * Operating cash flow totaled $2.0 billion, or 2.5 times net income * Full year 2007 earnings guidance raised to $5.54 per share

INDIANAPOLIS, April 25, 2007 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX News Network/ -- Well Point, Inc. (NYSE: WLP) today announced that first quarter 2007 net income was $783.1 million, or $1.26 per share, representing 16 percent growth over the first quarter of 2006. Net income in the first quarter of 2006 was $731.8 million, or $1.09 per share, including $0.01 per share in net realized investment losses. 
 
 
 
Your Company's: Code of Conduct is as follows: 
The Medtronic Mission
To contribute to human welfare by application of biomedical engineering
In the research, design, manufacture, and sale of instruments or appliances
That alleviates pain, restore health, and extend life.
To direct our growth in the areas of biomedical engineering where we display
Maximum strength and ability; to gather people and facilities that tend to
Augment these areas: to continuously build on these areas through
Education and knowledge assimilation; to avoid participation in areas
Where we cannot make unique and worthy contributions.
To strive without reserve for the greatest possible reliability and quality in
Our products; to be the unsurpassed standard of comparison and to be
Recognized as a company of dedication, honesty, integrity, and service.
To make a fair profit on current operations to meet our obligations, 
Sustain our growth, and reach our goals.
To recognize the personal worth of employees by providing an employment
Framework that allows personal satisfaction in work accomplished,
Security, advancement opportunity, and means to share in
The company's success To maintain good citizenship as a company. 
I am again puzzled. How is it that you maintain good citizenship as a company when you do not honor your true customer?
 
The cost of a new pump for me is $6,500 not including supplies. I would have been able to upgrade for $300 to $800. I was 3 weeks off in phoning for the upgrade, as I had not been notified during my warranty period as I had been in previous years when I upgraded. 
Yes, my insurance company will pay up to $3,500 in durable medical yearly then who pays for the supplies?
I am disappointed by your response. It does reflect a change in the times as you stated in your letter.
A change in attitude and treatment of the true customer.
Companies should make a profit. The issue is at what price is the profit made. Is using situational ethics the way to make a profit?
I cannot help think that if you and your company stood up for your true customer, the person who has diabetes you would have an increase in profits based on your integrity.
If what you say is true about reducing health care cost due to pump use and you prove that to the insurance industry do you not think that they would be promoting the pump as well?
 Or are the for profits so entrenched in the profit margin that the fact that diabetics can reduce their health care cost by using the most current technology in pump therapy a foolish idea. 
You make most of the money off supplies and if you created an on going pump exchange program your goodwill would increase volume by increasing profit of supplies. You could reduce the cost of the pump to the diabetic.  Your customer who wants to use the most current technology to stay alive. Not lose his or her feet, not go blind, have a heart attack, suffer from early dementia and the list goes on. 
The cost to treat the secondary diseases caused by diabetes is astronomical.
So why is it you are stuck in the box. You and your company have to ability to be leaders in the industry, by doing the right thing.
Making the customer the Diabetic. 
Negotiating with me regarding the pump has occurred only because I am currently involved in the system of health care.
What about the millions of diabetics who could be your customer who is lost in the diabetic health care maze.
You and your company should review The Medtronic Mission and put it into action not words on a piece of paper.

My 17 y.o. son Andrew had an incident when flying home from Paris to Los Angeles on his own with Air France.  They took his needles away from him even though the prescription was on the box and I had registered all of his diabetes needs with his reservation.  He was called a liar and told he would not be allowed on the flight. Distraught, angry and not wanting to create a scene, my son went to his seat and flew home without his box of needles.  Luckily he had a  stray needle in his packpack which he used for his Novolog and Lantus during his long flight home.  I have written in more detail to Air Frace customer relations, but I thought your group should be made aware of this deplorable incident as well.  Sincerely, Nina Hammerstein

I have a question about discrimination. I have type II Diabeties that developed because of me having PCOS. I use exercise, diet and medication to control my blood sugars. I was thinking about participating in a body building contest so I decided to hire an very experienced trainer in my home town. She was more than eager to start training me, she sent me numerous emails stating how interested and excited she was to train me for the competition. The trainer asked me to stop out and fill out a health questionare. After she read my questionare, I never heard from her again! She didn't return any of my phone calls or emails. Despite me having a serious disease, I am in very good health. My question is what should I do about this person. Should I send her a letter stating that I feel she has discriminated against me or talk to her employer. I'm so angry about being treated like this. Any advice you can offer me will be greatly appreciated.

I dont know where else to turn. I was disagnosed Type 2 in March 2007. I was laid off from my job in July 2007. I opted to take the COBRA coverage and then found out one payment into it that my prescription coverage had reached it'd maximum and wont renew until Jan. 2008. The medications I take are very expensive and I am living on unemployment and I cant afford to pay the 306.00 per month for the COBRA and the 100% prescription prices. If anything happens and I need to go to the doctor I will need the COBRA so I figure I cant let it lapse but what do I do about my medications and supplies? I havent been taking any of them properly to try and stretch them out and I haven't been testing because of the cost of the supplies! Help please!!! I've contacted some of the drug companies but you have to be without insurance to qualify. What do I do?

I dont know where else to turn. I was disagnosed Type 2 in March 2007. I was laid off from my job in July 2007. I opted to take the COBRA coverage and then found out one payment into it that my prescription coverage had reached it'd maximum and wont renew until Jan. 2008. The medications I take are very expensive and I am living on unemployment and I cant afford to pay the 306.00 per month for the COBRA and the 100% prescription prices. If anything happens and I need to go to the doctor I will need the COBRA so I figure I cant let it lapse but what do I do about my medications and supplies? I havent been taking any of them properly to try and stretch them out and I haven't been testing because of the cost of the supplies! Help please!!! I've contacted some of the drug companies but you have to be without insurance to qualify. What do I do?

I'm a TypeII diabetic. I am 66 years age, I was using my glocometer in the lobby of Bob Evans Restaurant in Centerville, Ohio. 
There were no customers who could possibly have seen me doing it. An extremely rude assistant manager, (Cathy) stormed into the foyer in the witness of the cashier/hostess and yelled at me...&quot;do you know how bad that looks in front of our customers? That belongs in the doctor's office&quot;
Totally ignorant of what I was doing, she went out of the way to observe me. 'Follow up...
I'm sick of &quot;you people&quot; (reference to several diabetics who come in their unit on a daily basis). 
The profile of their customer base is largely over 50's and several regulars are insulin dependent or use Byetta and the like, but they check their blood glucose levels before they eat. 
They all try to keep the AccuChecks etc concealed, but kids see it and rudely go out of their way to bring attention to the situation when they see it.
She is insensed over it an gives everyone very hard looks. She has even told her servers not to wait on us unless we demand service.
Her lack of knowledge and sensitivity is completely Cretin. 
I brought this to the attention of their corporate personnel guy in Columbus, Ohio. She was immediately given a promotion and a reassignment to another unit on Col.Glenn Highway in Fairborn, Ohio, across from Wright State University.
Obviously the company has endorsed this ignorance and lack of sensitivty and has not taken an effort to educate people with special needs.
The &quot;you people&quot; categorization tells me that she has a clear bias against anyone who has to monitor their sugar levels. Their menu is another clear example of complete ignorance.
I cannot help wondering how they relate to their own diabeticemployees who get very irregular workbreaks and operate under terrific stress levels.
I guess they have a way of dealing with &quot;those people&quot;.
I have not been in a Bob Evans store in several months, and I have asked my diabetic friends to boycott the place. 
Sincerely,
Ron Kuczak

Hello,

I am a pharmacy student on a Diabetes Committee with American Pharmacists Association. My fellow students and I are planning a big screening, and I was thinking about the possibility of getting some literature from ADA to give out at the screening (bilingual literature would also be helpful if available). Please let me know if any can be obtained! Thank you so much,

I have submitted a doctors request as well as a personal request for resonable accomadation to my Human Resources office. I am a mailhandler with the Fort Worth USPS. It is into the third week now with no response. I have called Kathy Dowden (817-317-3388) the HR person who has my letter. She has said that she will respond to it. I am still waiting. Sent all communications that are involved with this fiasco to the Plant manager. Have also contacted the Americans with Disibilities. All I want is a daytime work schedule instead of 5:00PM to 11:00PM. So I can maintain my glucose with more efficiency. It would be very helpfull if someone from your agency could contact Kathy Dowden and explain to her that while I'm waiting for her to make some kind of a decesion my sugar levels are very hard to control!

For several years I have been getting my medication, which included Metformin, Lantus and Prandin, from the pharmaceutical company producing each medication. Now I'm told that because I am eligible for Medicare D (I am disabled) the will no longer provide the necessary medication. I've explained to them that I live on a minimum income and that the premium for the medicare D as well as the copays for the meds are just too much for me to handle. They still refuse. 

Do you know of any other source for necessary medications?

Thanks.

We are the parent of an 8 years old who was diagnosed 3 years ago just before she began Kindergarten.
Through K-2 grades there was a NURSE at my child's school. The district moved the MH classes out of our daughters school so a &quot;nurse&quot; is no longer required. So, this year there is NOT a nurse at our school.  There is a full-time health aid.
The health aid has been doing this for 14 years and NEVER dealt with a diabetic child.
There is a nurse who oversees our school but is not housed at our school. 
I (mom) have been sitting at my child's school 7 hours a day EVERYDAY since school began on August 23rd. I have left for ONLY brief times over the past 4.5 weeks.
OUR QUESTION:  WHY do the ADA and our Endocrinologist's NOT support having a NURSE in schools where there are children with Type 1 Diabetes?      WHY?
Our school health aid is being &quot;trained&quot; by the nurse a little bit here and there.  The nurse has &quot;identified&quot; a &quot;core group&quot; of school personnel who want to be &quot;trained.&quot;
We've also been told &quot;nothing is going to happen quickly.&quot;
Please do not misunderstand, my husband and I totally believe in training people in how to handle a diabetic emergency.  Much like people are encouraged to train in CPR.
HOWEVER, is this &quot;training&quot; suppose to make us feel confident that we can leave our child at school and she is completely covered for those 7 hours everyday, 5 days a week?
A building that houses over 400 other students?
After this &quot;training&quot; the nurse is going to be able to handle whatever diabetic emergency comes up along with all the other health duties that need to be handled ? ? ? ? 
WHY is type 1 diabetes, in our schools,  being treated with such insignificance? 
WHY are &quot;trained&quot; lay people considered appropriate healthcare for our Type 1 Diabetic children?
AGAIN...OUR QUESTION:  WHY do the ADA and our Endocrinologist's NOT support having a NURSE in schools where there are children with Type 1 Diabetes?      WHY?

We are TRY so hard to wrap our minds around this and finding it IMPOSSIBLE !
PLEASE help us understand !

Hello,
I am very concerned about my grandmother who has diabetes. She has had an open wound that the local hospital has been treating for 2 months now. They have now told her that if the infection doesn't clear within this week that they will have to remove her leg.

My question is how do we know that this is the only option for her? She is 96 years old and the pain is just killing her. She has had open heart surgery and now has a pacemaker. I am very concerned as we live aways away from bigger facilities with more experienced doctors and just want to know if there are other options for her. 

I really can't see her making it through the surgery let alone just being put under. 
The wound is about 3 inches long and 1 1/2 to 2 inches wide, it is almost greenish looking and they are just treating it by changing the dressing every other day and it has no had air since they have started treating her. This has been for 2 months now. 

I still think that maybe a heat lamp or something would help to get a little air instead of constantly keeping the wound dressed. Please if you have any idea if there would be another option I would greatly appreciate it. Also if there is any further information I could send you I would be more than happy to. 

Thanks So Very Much,
I love my Gram very much and hate seeing her in pain as well as living with the idea of losing her leg.

Health Insurance: I recently relocated to take a job in Fla. The health insurance plan has a 1-yr pre-existing illness clause, unless I can provide proof of insurance coverage w/ i the last yr. My last insurance coverage ended 13 mos. ago. I now cannot be covered for any diabetes-related expense for the next year. My ophthalmologist is recommending treatment for retinopathy -- which it seems I'll have to pay out of pocket. This hardly seems equitable to me -- under this ins. plan, I could obtain immediate coverage if I was pregnant. Or, I could quit my job and obtain Medicaid coverage. I could not afford the $600/mo cobra fee when my last insurance ended and thought I would find work more quickly than I did. When I applied for the state insurance pool where I was living, I found out I would have had to apply within 6 mos. of losing my insurance. Indeed, I did investigate the pool within that time period, but delayed deciding upon it, because it could not inform me if it covered diabetes supplies. I also had difficulty locating a private insurer who would cover me.

It seems I've suffered from a lack of information -- had I known about the pool's requirements, about the pre-exisiting requirements, etc etc. -- 
perhaps I would have made different decisions.

It's easy to fall through the 'cracks', despite one's educational level. The system feels discriminatory -- why should I be prevented from seeking care for the only issue that threatens my health -- and is not induced by poor health habits?

I'm still trying to figure out how I'll pay for laser treatment ----

thanks for listening  ---

Hi,

My daughter is a kinder student. She was recently given the California English Learner Development Test (CELDT). The school did not advised me that she was going to be taking a test. Thus, in her 504 plan I just requested to have my daugther moniter and injected for lunch time. Initially I was up set because my daughter speaks english fluently and I knew she did not meet the criteria to take the test according to the state. However, Los Angeles Unified School District has been testing children that are exposed to a second language even though the children are fluent in English.
My daughter did not pass the test. When I saw the results something tells me that her test is not congruent. She responded well to all the sections except in the category where there were 20 questions, She scored 0.

Thus, first of all she is a kinder with a short attention span but additionally she has diabetes type 1. I called LAUSD to let them know that I felt my daughter was in disadvantage becuase I did not request any test accommotations. Basically they said that she could not repeat that part of the testing. Pretty much I feel that they did not care for not be able to meet her needs.

My daughter failed the test with about 13points. Thus, now she has been labeled an English learner.
According to the state that program is for children that do not speak English at home but LAUSD has taken advantage of the freedom that the state gives them to implement the program.

What else can I do? At school they feel I am making a big deal but I honestly feel that my daughter could have done a lot better if she would have been given the proper acommotations. I did not expect her to be tested in kinder. I do not know if she got stress due to her diabetes or if she was just being a normal kinder student that lost interest after 15-20 minutes. Thus any how I feel that it is a ridiculus test for kinders to take and many teachers and parents feel that the test is not accurate.

Please help!

Paula Grandin, Manager
Davis Vision 
536 Rt. 111
Hauppauge, NY 11787

Dear Paula:

I am writing to formally request a reasonable accommodation for my disabling condition (diabetes) that is recognized by Federal and State laws governing reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities.
Although I am otherwise qualified for my position, my varied work hours limit my ability to follow a regular pattern of sleep, diet, and medication, (causing fatigue and blood sugar complications due to meal times and the inability to take my medication during regularly scheduled meals).  I am requesting a weekday schedule of 9:00 AM to 5:30 PM to alleviate complications caused by my medical condition.
In addition to alleviating diabetic problems caused by my current work hours,  a schedule ending before dark will also alleviate my vision problem while driving at night (which may or may not be affected by my diabetes).

While there are other obstacles associated with my condition, I have, so far, been able to work around them and foresee no further complications (at this time) should I receive reasonable accommodation. 

According to the American's With Disabilities Act:

Employers are required to make &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; if requested by an employee with a disability, unless the accommodation would cause an &quot;undue hardship&quot; on the employer because of significant difficulty or expense. The accommodations that people with diabetes need are usually easy and inexpensive. For example, a person with diabetes might require accommodations such as:
&amp;#61623; Breaks to check blood glucose levels, eat a snack, or go to the bathroom. 
&amp;#61623; The ability to keep diabetes supplies and food nearby. 
&amp;#61623; The opportunity to work a modified schedule or to work a standard shift.

From my experience with Davis Vision, I know that a modified schedule that I requested would not put an undue hardship on the company since there are employees who work several days at the time I requested, at least one employee scheduled for three 9-5:30 days.

If you would like medical verification of my disability, I can provide you with the appropriate documentation upon your request.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.  I would appreciate a response to this letter within one week so that I can be as efficient in my job as possible.

I was recently released from prison, my conviction overturned by the Supreme Court.  I am without any health insurance and, in fact, the prison lost my wallet and I have no id, ss card or anything else.  I have no means because of this to receive help for supplies and medications.  Because of 'red tape' it is going to take several weeks to gather documentation.  The only thing I have is a certified birth certificate.  It would be good to see a special department on the web for special problems such as mine. 
   In addition, the diabetic who died because he could not get his meds in the Ramsey County Jail - I experienced the same thing in a Kentucky prison!

I am a Type I who struggled through the early days of the insulin pump in having it approved for my care 26 years ago.  After 45 years with the disease, nerve damage has left me with hypoglycemia unawareness so as soon as glucose sensors became available to anyone who would pay for them, I signed on, and they have literally saved my life on numerous occasions.  I've been fighting Tricare (military) insurance to cover costs at the same rate that my insulin pump is covered.  They claim they can't because they're too new, unproven, and &quot;luxury&quot; items.  I got nowhere writing the Surgeon General (who wears an insulin pump) and going through a lenghty appeals process, with denial after denial.  I can no longer work and am still in the Social Security Disability appeals process waiting for a hearing date for over a year.  Meanwhile, my teaching retirement is only $300 per month, yet my retired Colonel and I find the sensors too important NOT to have, so the $365 for 10 of them (a month's supply) takes priority over all else.  One agency, Foundation Care, covered them for one month recently as part of my pharmacy benefit for the usual $9 co-pay, but now they and Tricare say they can no longer do that.  Tricare says they made a &quot;mistake&quot;.  I'd like to hear how the ADA might advocate for people like me who need these sensors.  If we need to start a group, I'd be willing to head it.  I just need some direction.  Thanks.

G2 Promotional Marketing is teaming up with Kraft Foods and Winn-Dixie Pharmacy to deliver a series of in-store health fairs, in an effort to educate shoppers about Diabetes and to offer food and meal solutions for those who are living with Diabetes. More specifically, our agency is creating a booklet to hand out at these in-store events that includes healthy living tips, diabetic-approved Kraft brands and recipes, and coupons  all of which are geared towards improving the quality of life for those living with Diabetes.

Winn-Dixie is interested in including the ADA logo on the booklet to further educate shoppers about the resources available for those living with Diabetes. My question for you is, what sort of approval process is involved in gaining rights to use the ADA logo for this particular booklet? 

If you are not the appropriate contact, could you please point me in the right direction of who might be able to provide the approval process/requirements for using the ADA logo? I have been searching the ADA website, but have not been able to find anything related to logo usage. Any feedback or assistance you can provide is greatly appreciated! Please feel free to contact me at jcook@g2.com or 312-229-8510.


Thank You,

HOw can I /we get assistance to change the Department of Education regulations about IDDM, bus drivers???   By their regs, My husbands HA1c had gone from 5.4 to 6.2 over the past year.  I have explored all available to me about the Oregon Administrative Rules governing CBG testing and numbers needed to be able to drive.  In order to raise his CBG to be within their limits he has to NOT take the Lantus insulin.  The oregon admin rules are: 581-053-0002(5)(C)(b) page 6(F)(i) Lines 36,37,38.  Page 7,line 7,8,9, HbA1c test values of between 5.9 &amp; 9.6...  HELP.  These state regulations are the PITS.  While he is within these guidelines, his diabetes is not in as good control as they used to be...

My daughter is a member of ADA.  She has been a Type 1 diabetic for 12 years, and strives for tight control.  This year she is attending graduate school at Agnes Scott College, a small private school in Atlanta, Ga.  She was told by the person who handles disability students at Agnes Scott that she looked healthy, and that 504 plans did not apply to Agnes Scott since they are a private school.  The disabilities person explained the way Agnes Scott College handles disabilities.  My daughter was told to go to her teachers and explain her medical condition.  If the teacher wants to make accommodations it is up to her/him.  Whatever happens, the teacher's say is always final.  We never had these problems at the University of Georgia when she was an undergraduate student. She had a 504 plan and used it twice in the 4 years it took to get her biology degree - once when she had biochem and organic chem finals back to back on the same day, and another when her blood glucose level was exessive.  My daughter feels uncomfortable discussing all the nuances of her medical condition with her teachers.  She already ran into one problem with a cell biology exam she had to take when she was running a blood glucose level of 480+. The insensitivity is new to us and my daughter does not even know if it's legal to require her to discuss her medical condition with her teachers.  Are there advocacy groups in the Atlanta area that you could direct us to? I couldn't find this on the website.

Thank you.

I have a question about the information requested for a new Florida drivers license.  On your website you mentioned briefly that Florida used to have specific guidelines for diabetes but had dropped the policy (not quoting).

When I tried to register online there was a specific question about whether I was &quot;insulin-dependent&quot;.

I've taken insulin for 42 years and am extremely reponsible about testing glucose and driving.  I am concerned that this is placing me into an &quot;impaired condition&quot; with the state of FL that I don't wish to be placed.

It is very unclear as to how the info is used.  They state in the general license info that one may &quot;request&quot; to have insulin-dependent noted on the license...which I think is a good idea for emergency personnel.

But, is that information placing me in a negative category with the state and will it require further medical backup each year?

The info is very vague on the website.  I would like to know more about how Florida deals with insulin-dependent drivers (with a good record) before I visit the DMV.

Thanks,
Catherine Whitt
Type 1 - 42 years and a perfect driving record!

We need help.  My daughter was employed by Frederick Memorial Hospital (Frederick MD) as a CMA for a doctor's office in Union Bridge MD.  She was in her 90 day probabion period when she became sick from diabetes realated health issues.  She had never been sick or missed work because of diabetes before.  She was hospitalized twice within 2 weeks (4 days each), then contracted C-diff (antibiotic resistant infection).  Her doctor and the CDC would not allow her to return to work for two additional weeks.  The hospital fired her for &quot;missing too many days&quot; upon her doctor's note that she could return to work.  I have no doubt that she was fired because FMH is a self insured organization and she was costing them too much money.  She is in the COBRA program, but they have began to deny her bills.  Her pancrease is dead and she was prescribed an insulin pump--which the hospital's insurance front deemed &quot;not medically necessary&quot;.  Who can I get help from?

Dear Sir or Madam:

I have a question in regards to my legal rights.  I recently went for a pre-employment physical.  I have uncontrolled diabetes as I have not been monitoring my diabetes as I should.  The doctor that performed the physical stated that he will not sign a paper saying that I am physically fit to work until I get my HG A1C below 8.  I do not know my level as it has been a while since I have seen a doctor.

Other than my diabetes I have no other physical ailments.  I am perfectly able to work.  I feel that this doctor is discriminating against me.  I understand I should see a doctor and keep my diabetes up, however, I do not feel that a doctor should have the right to state that I am not physically fit just because I have no seen a diabetic doctor.

I have had to borrow money from family to get an appointment with a doctor and to get the blood work done.  If the blood work comes back at the level the doctor doesn't like, then it is highly likely that this doctor will say I'm not physically able to work.  I feel that this is completely ridiculous and discriminates against diabetics.

Doctors are not cheap.  $70 for an office visit and about $80 for lab work.  This is not even taking in to account the costs for purchasing a machine and strips as well as regular diabetic necessities such as insulin and needles.

I find it easy for doctors like the one I encountered to have such a harsh attitude when they don't have the financial burdens I have.

I would like to know if there is any legal ramifications on my part?

Regards,
Nicholas P. Hillebran

My 19yr old child with type 1 diabetes was put on standby for a flight. Her original flight was delayed due to airline staff issues.  When she was on the jet way she was told she could not take on her carry on.  She informed the staff she had medical supplies and it could not be checked.  They said they didn't care, she had to check the bag.  She didn't know what to do so she left the plane.  This caused her to miss an international flight and delay travel by three days.  What were her rights if any?  I would like to know as she does travel and this issue could arise again.

Hello. I have a question.  I need to take the assessment/placement test at the community college.  The test is timed.  I get 5 hours.  I explained to the adviser that  I am a diabetic and will need to take a break during the test to eat at least once maybe twice and asked if I could have extra time on the test to make up for the time i need to take to eat, since i HAVE to eat,it's not a option.  The adviser told me No,I do not get extra time on the test.  What are my options?  There has to be some law that allows me to make up this time! Is Diabetes mentioned in the americans with disiabilities act?

I have a question regarding reasonable accomodations in the workplace.  My husband is a type two diabetic (actually they suspect that he is a third type of diabetic that starts as a type two and then medically mimics a type one). In spite of the fact that we take his diet and exercise very seriously, his illness seems to progress.  Presently he tests 4 times a day and takes insulin 4 times per day.  My husband works as a correctional officer.  Recently he was put on a fast acting insulin.  Up until this point he was able to keep his supplies in his car and test when needed.  However, he was recently put on a fast acting insulin and now has to worry about going low very quickly.  My husband approached his employer about identifying a location in which he could test and administer insulin in private.  He was told to keep his medical supplies in his locker and do whatever he needed to.  Maybe this is as good as it gets in the workplace.  I am a teacher and very familiar with 504 in the school setting.  Our concern in that other staff members should be able to access his insulin and tester if he becomes unable to do so himself. In addition, he wants privacy and does not want others to see him.  I am concerned at the sanitary conditions near the lockers.  My question is whether or not it is reasonable to request a private location and that coworkers are aware of the location of his supplies in case he goes low and can't access them.  We do not want to impose on the system or cause unnecessary stress on others.  There is a medical clinic at the jail.  My thought is that this might be a good location for storing his supplies and testing.  In addition, other staff members could be made aware to call the medical unit if he is in  trouble.  I appreciate your thoughts on this matter. 
Thank you in advance for your help.

Sincerely,

Beth Green

I was recently in a jail in Picayune, MS.  I am a 37 year old type 1 diabetic.  I was refused my insulin several times which means I couldn't eat in order to keep my blood glucose down.  I was also denied my high blood pressure medicine and in the proper dosages.  I slept on a stone platform, no pillow or blanket freezing cold.  They had NO resource to check my blood sugar as I had requested.  They simply asked what do you take?  I stated my insulin is based on a sliding scale based on a test of my blood sugar.  I had to &quot;guess&quot; as to what my sugar was doing.  I know that I would have died in there if I stayed any longer.  Do I have rights under section 1983 part 42? This made me quite ill while being there.  Is there any legal recourse for me? I don't want this to happen to anyone else.  Hearing cries for medicine and better conditions was enough.

I believe the ADA website has alot of info for the families with diabeties. But the google would not let me look up diff. type log sheets or even insulin? 
Hope they are really working on filling in all thier info fully.
I think that the hosp.,Doctors,ie:medical,eyes,dentist...etc assoc. with diabeties are taking advantage of state and federally provided ins. monies of children with diabeties.
Example: my son seen eye doctor for check up and was issued glasses he did not need. The prescription was boosted for the sale not his own benefit. Please advise an be aware!!

Actually I have a question. I am insulin dependant diabetic, recently I lost my job for false positive on breathalyzer. Had reading of .005 and .004. I do not drink , after I left the plant I went directly to the doctors office and had blood work done which came back 0% ethenol. I am as you would imagine fighting for my job. I have found several articals that support that diabetics can have false positives. I know if I file for unemployment with my test results I will win that claim. My employer was informed that I had diabetes when I was going through physical for pre employment. Based on zero tolerance I have lost my job. If I do not win my job back is there anything else that I can do? I can's help that a diabetic's body chemistry is different than other peoples. I also know that if I have to find other employment this could be an issue again, not just for me but other diabetics. If you could please assist me I would greatly appreciate it.

I'm a long-time (28 years) Type I diabetic, who is under good control, but suffers from hypoglycemic unawareness.  Recently I suffered a severe hypoglycemic episode at work.  I have almost no memory of the events that took place, but a female employee present during the episode has since filed a sexual harassment complaint against me, apparently based on my using &quot;inappropriate language&quot; during the episode.

My employers know I am a diabetic (I was hospitalized about a year ago for a similar episode), and asked me what to look out for.  I told them to be aware of odd behavior, etc.

I don't know what to do about this; I feel I'm treated as a harasser, when I don't know (and noone will tell me) what I said or did during the episode!

Can you give me some advice or tell me who to contact for help?

I have 4 yr old who should be in pre-school in September.  I have plenty of preschools in our area, however none receive federal funds, except the public preschool.  The private preschools will take her, but none are willing to test or give her medicine if needed.  The public preschool has refused her, saying she doesn't fit the criteria for admittance, i.e- financial need.  Is there anything I can do to gain her admittance.  I understand financial need, but I feel that the result is the same even though we can afford private preschool- she cannot go to a preschool under her condition without someone trained in Diabetes on site.

I applied for the Call to Congress under this email and I am worried that a response will not get to me due to the email address changing.  My new email address is:  gloryrevealed7@comcast.net.  I really do want to go to call for congress this year.  I am even working at a Diabetes Center in Brentwood, Tn and doing a lot with this company for Diabetic Patients over the age of 65.  My updated phone number is:  615-739-6230.  Can you get me to the right place?

I would like know if there is a local advocate in Louisville Kentucky with the American Diabetes Assoc. My ex-wife and myself believe that my son is being discrimated against in his school. Summary: The Special Education Group believe the reason my can not learn is because he is a diabetic. His diabetic specialist wrote the school that diabetes is not the reason that our son can't learn. Now our son per them is not qualified to recieve any additional help in school. Please inform me of any local Advocate that would be willing to listen to our case. Thank you for your time.

I have son in a military academy that was diagnosed with type one diabetes at the age of 19.  I am looking for a diabetes expert that can help establish his fitness for duty to serve in the military.  If that is reasonable.  His desire is to complete his academy training and become an active duty officer.  The service is considering his early dismissal.

Maybe you can help me. I'm 63 years old without any form on insurance.  My insulin is costing me 
$98 a month.  My income has been cut in-half due to going from 40 hrs per week to 20 hrs per week.
I thought I would qualify for a medical card but I was turned down.  I now must wait until I'm 65 or cut more hours.  I certainly cannot cut anymore hours.  I just had a mini stroke and my blood sugar was over 800 when I went into the hospital.  Is there anywhere that I might obtain assistant to help with my insulin.  I have no idea where to turn.  Thank you for your time.
Sincerely
Ella Gregory

Do you have any information as to why this year 2008 Medicare moved Byetta from a levil 2 to a levil 3 medication causing a monthly cost increase of $170.00. No one at my insurance company knows who makes these decisions only that they get a list from the state telling them what levil drugs are to be copayed on. The state of Va who negoates my insurance  as I retired from  Va goverment service. tells me the same thing only they get there list from Medicare. But dont have a contact person at medicare. Medicare tell me that the only waay they change drug coverage levils is if there is a generic or the drug is found to be dangerious or inefective. According to the pharmacist he has no information to either or these conditions exhisting. A response would be appreciated.

Why can't diabetic adults with Medicaid primary receive a pair of shoes yearly as do those on Medicare?  Wouln't it be cost effective as a diabetes preventative to issue a pair of shoes? As a Certified Pedorthist, I have to turn away several people a week who are Medicaid primary. These people need a thorough exam, education on foot care, and properly fitting shoes to help prevent amputations.  A pair of shoes (which includes an examination and education) is much cheaper than a hospital stay/and/or amputation.

I am contacting you to find support for my cause.  I am the mother of a 7year old who has type 1 diabetes.  He was diagnosed in August 2007 and started school as a first grader in the the same month.  I am currently advocating for a full time nurse in his school.  He has a nurse who splits her time between two schools here in town and is not always available at my son's school.  I have had to go in and train the school staff on caring for my son. The staff is not comfortable to be able to care for him in times of need.  To complicate his needs, he also has a peanut allergy and needs an epi-pen and a school plan for that as well.  I understand that the national average for nurse to student ratio is 1 nurse per 750 students approximately.  I also understand that here in Wyoming we beat that average, but that number does not take into account how many of those students are special needs and the distance that the nurse has to travel to meet the needs of all the students.  I have been told by our School Administration that there is not room in our budget for a full-time nurse, as our budget is based on enrollment.  I am currently seeking other funding for this cause and would like some help.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

I have diabetes and my manger including my management chain is aware of my disease. I currently have Family Medical Leave Act paperwork filed with my employer. In a recent (with the last 7 days) 2007 annual review of my performance, I negative assessment, for what my manager perceived as not providing customer service to my peers. This refers to days I was absent from work because of my diabetes and using FMLA leave.

I believe this to be discrimination on the basis of my disease? My manager has indicated that the days I were absent and on FMLA leave a directly related to the negative review.

Please advise?

May 30, 2008

To whom it may concern:

I am a registered nurse with great interest in diabetes care. There are efforts to improve care for patients with diabetes through the bills introduced on the federal and state level. The National Diabetes Coordinator Act of 2008 (S 2742/HR 4836) introduced in the senate this year is one of concern to me. 

This bill has good intentions of reducing incidence, progression and impact of diabetes by appointing a National Diabetes Coordinator to be an advisor. However, if one appoints a national coordinator for diabetes, other national coordinators for major diagnosis may have to be considered as well. I believe that instead of spending funds on a new position, the funds for existing programs should be increased to improve the quality of care offered to patients with diabetes. Please consider opposing the National Diabetes Coordinator Act of 2008 (S 2742/HR 4836).

I would appreciate knowing your position on the bill.

Sincerely,
Chie Newsom, RN

On your survey about the school nurse problem,
there was no column that said: I am diabetic!  You
have: I am the parent of a diabetic child.  But,
there simply was no space for that or for being a
teacher who is diabetic?  Just a comment.
